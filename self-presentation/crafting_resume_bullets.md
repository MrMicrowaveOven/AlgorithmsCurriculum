# Crafting Resume Bullets

The primary purpose of your resume is to demonstrate to a recruiter that you possess specific
skills. Recruiters spend only a few seconds glancing over your resume so you have to rely on
keywords to tell the story.

## Steps to take

1. Identify a key skill that you will demonstrate. See [this list][keywords] for ideas.
2. Answer the following for each bullet:
  * What did I do?
  * How does it demonstrate the key skill? (May be apparent from the "what")
  * What was the impact or benefit?
  
Compile a list of the skills you want to demonstrate, then craft your bullets around them.

## Example 1 (Non technical)
__Skill to Demonstrate__: Leadership

__What did I do?__: Founded company softball team

__How does it demonstrate the key skill?__: Took initiative. Organized long-term project.

__What was the impact or benefit?__: Improved team morale and collaboration.

__Result__: "Founded and managed company softball team, resulting in improved morale and communication."

## Example 2 (Technical)
__Skill to Demonstrate__: Scaling an App

__What did I do?__: Stored images in the cloud using AWS S3

__How does it demonstrate the key skill?__: Shows I know how to use AWS S3 to scale an app

__What was the impact or benefit?__: Reduces server load allows for scale.

__Result__: "Stores image uploads in the cloud using AWS S3, reducing server load and allowing for scale."
