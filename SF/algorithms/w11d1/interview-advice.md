# Interview Advice

* You'll be asked a series of questions of increasing difficulty.
    * The interviewer wants to see how you think. They want to max you
      out.
    * Don't be discouraged if you don't get all problems correct;
      you're not supposed to.
* Be excited
    * Engineers like people who are excited about solving new problems.
    * Engineering is all about solving problems you haven't seen
      before.
    * Never seem standoffish about getting a hard problem; make the
      best of it.
* Using the whiteboard
    * Write big and neatly; your interviewer will have less fun if they
      struggle to read your writing.
    * Use a real programming language; pseudo-code is not cool.
    * That said, your code is not supposed to be perfect.
    * Leave lots of space to make additions; do not close "do"s with
      "end"s prematurely.
    * You can make marginal notes.
* Always be talking
    * Talk through the problem as you do it. Engage the interviewer.
    * If you get stuck, describe what you're thinking.
