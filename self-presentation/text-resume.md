#Make a text-only version of your finished resume

When applying to a position via email, use your cover letter as the body of the email, and attach your resume as a pdf.  Whe applying via a website, however, you may be asked to copy & paste your resume text into a field. In these cases, it is useful to have a text-only version of your resume handy.  

1) After the final draft of your resume is complete, copy & paste the text into a text editor. 
2) Replace all live links with url's.  
3) Reformat the resume so it us easy to read in a text only format.  

**If the site asks for a pdf attachment as well as a copy & paste, use your text-only resume for the copy/paste, and the pdf as the attachment.  

An example project description in a text-only resume might look like
