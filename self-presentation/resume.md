# Preparing your Resume
* Your résumé is your best shot at proving you're not a yahoo.
* What's on there makes a big difference.
* What's not on there, and how you lay everything out, makes an equally big difference.

No one likes opening Word documents. When your résumé is done, export it to a PDF.

Check out Gayle Laakmann McDowell's [model résumé][glm-resume]. At the bottom there's a template to make your own résumé too. Gayle Laakman McDowell is the author of [Cracking the Coding Interview][cracking-interview].

# Layout
* ONE PAGE ONLY
* Lots and lots of whitespace


# Content

In the world of people, having a diversity of interests and experiences is a beautiful thing. In the world of tech recruiting, expertise is much more valuable. Avoid letting your résumé suggest you were at one point unsure of what you wanted to do in life.    
 
You don't want to leave out large chunks of time either. If you did one thing for over a year, include it. You knew what you wanted, but then you changed your mind. In this case, be ready to have a very good answer for anyone who asks you why you changed your mind.    

 Use this bar for what goes on your résumé:
* Ask yourself: would I score real points with my interviewer for talking about this more than 5 minutes?
* If the answer is no, leave it out.



## Relevant Links
* Github
* Portfolio
* LinkedIn

Bonus (if they're good):
* Tumblr
* Twitter

## Skills
 List these skills, and any other relevant ones.
* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Backbone.js
* SQL
* Git
* HTML
* CSS
* Web Development

 *Do not* try to organize your skills by proficiency. Ie. Don't do this:    
    Proficient: Ruby, Rails, JS    
    Familiar: SQL, Backbone

 That makes you look less confident. However it's ok to do this:    
    Ruby, Rails, JS, Backbone, C (learning)

## Technical
* List your past projects and the main technologies you used (no need to mention jQuery or jQuery UI)
* For each project, highlight one or two cool features and a problem you solved while implementing it.
	* Did you bootstrap some data to avoid extraneous AJAX requests? Did you make some tough choices in your database schema? Did you use cookies to store anything other than a session token?
* Look up how to spell and capitalize the technologies you mention.


Your projects are one of the biggest selling poinsts so you sell them well. Don't list every single library you used. What matters is the features you built and the problems you solved on the way. Anytime you had to sit back and think about a feature before implementing it, you were solving a problem.

To indentify cool problems you solved, make a quick list of five neat features in your app. Mentally step through the code that powers each feature. At every step, consider whether you could have built things differently. If looking back you find that there were actually different ways to do it, that's a good that sign you solved an interesting problem.

 To get you brainstorming:    
    Did you find some clever way to DRY up your code?    
    Does you Javascript use any math to resize something in the DOM?    
    Did you use a library in a way that its author probably didn't expect?    
    Do you have any data that's nested one degree deeper than usual?    
    Did you override a Rails or Backbone.js method?    
    Do your ActiveRecord models have methods to run specific queries?    
    Do you make AJAX requests to any unexpected routes?    


## Work
Unless you worked as a web developer, this section is mainly to demonstrate that you are a functional member of society. No need to add much detail.


Things to **leave out**:

* Service jobs that paid the bills (waiter, grocery clerk, library assistant...).
* Jobs or internships having nothing to do with computers or the web.

Things to **include**:

* Jobs where the web or some other computer technology was involved (eg. QA Tester).
   * Highlight a time when you taught yourself something technical on the job.
* Jobs where number-crunching was involved (analyst-type roles)

## Education
* Don't mention App Academy
* It's totally cool to leave out this section if you don't have a college degree.

## Personal
Only include this section if:
* You have a lot of whitespace.
* You have smart-person hobbies or talents (like chess).
