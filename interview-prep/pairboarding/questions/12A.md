## Introduction

Tell me your story.

## Fun with `NaN`

In Javascript, what is `NaN` and what is its type?  How can you test if a value is equal to `NaN`?

## `next_largest`

Given a node in a Binary Search Tree, find the node with the next
largest value. Assume you don't have the root of the tree, just a
single node from it.

```ruby
# O(log(n)) if BST is balanced
def next_largest(node)
  if node.right
    # find smallest node to the right
    return left_most_node(node.right)
  end

  # no nodes to the right; climb up
  until true
    parent_node = node.parent
    if parent_node.nil?
      # at the top of the tree, and nothing bigger to the right.
      return nil
    elsif parent_node.left == node
      # parent is bigger than us
      return parent_node
    else
      # parent is smaller, keep climbing.
      node = parent_node
    end
  end
end

def left_most_node(node)
  # keep going down and to the left
  node = node.left until node.left.nil?

  node
end
```

## `isBalancedTree`

Write a JavaScript function to check if a binary tree is balanced. A
tree is balanced if, at every node, the depth of subtree on the left
hand side is equal to the depth of the subtree on the right (plus or minus
one).

```js

// Take in the root node
function isBalanced (node) {
  // Base case: the tree is empty.  Return true.
  if (!node) {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Get the depths of left and right subtrees and compare
  var leftDepth = getDepth(node.left);
  var rightDepth = getDepth(node.right);
  var depthDiff = Math.abs(leftDepth - rightDepth);
  
  // The tree is balanced if both subtrees are balanced AND 
  // the difference in depths of those subtrees is between -1 and 1
  return (isBalanced(node.left) && isBalanced(node.right)) && depthDiff < 2;
}

function getDepth (node) {
  // Base case: empty tree.  Depth is 0.
  if (!node) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Take the larger depth of the two subtrees, calculated recursively
  return Math.max(getDepth(node.left), getDepth(node.right)) + 1;
}
```
