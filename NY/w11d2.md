* Continue pairboarding (don't forget to practice personal pitch)
* Add 10 companies to your Job Search Roadmap
* Do one practice problem on [HackerRank][HackerRank] and one demo test on [Codility][Codility].  Companies sometimes use these platforms during interviews, so familiarize yourself with the environment in advance.
* Last day of reviewing Job App Materials! Make it good!
  * After reviewing and applying all edits your reviewers suggest, submit your resume for review on the Jobberwocky.
  * Don't forget to give us "Can Edit" permissions, not just "Can Comment"
  * Check back frequently to see if we've reviewed it and sent it back to you. Also check it was marked as completed- we may have put some last to-dos in there. If it's not marked as completed, resolve the to-dos and resubmit for another review.
