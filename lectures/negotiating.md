## Reasons to Negotiate
* Opportunity cost
* Be valued and invested in
* For the company: don't get poached

## Internal Structures: HR vs. Tech
CEO, C-suite
=> HR: stay under budget
=> Engineering: get the best people possible

## Employers:
* They will reject you
* They will ask you salary requirements
* They will say they're taking a chance on you
* They will promise future riches
* They will want you to decide on the spot

## Recruiters
* Keep them in the dark
  * About your salary range
  * About where you're applying

## Pre-Offer negotiations
Don't talk salary until they make you an offer. If they insist, say
  * I just want fair market value.
  * I trust that [company]'s offer will be in that range.

If they insist on a number, say
  * [company] is probably better positioned to know what fair market value is.
  * I found [these numbers][salary-data] on Indeed and Robert Half.
  * Those are just two data points so I'm not sure how reliable they are.

## Game plan
 * **ASK FOR TWO WEEKS**
 * Contact all previous companies
 * Let me know
 * If they push for less wait time, you get to ask for more.
 * If they don't, you get to look for competing offers.

## Assembling a package
* Full-time vs. Part-time
* Base
* Benefits
* Bonus 
* New computer
* PTO: set or unlimited
* Terms
* Options

## How to value options
An "option" means that you're guaranteed the ability to buy something in the
future at a price that's set in the present. For example, American Airlines
might buy oil options from Bank of America so that they can put an upper limit
on the amount they spend on airplane fuel next year, even if oil prices go up
dramatically.

You might be given options to buy stock in your company when you're hired.
Typically these are options to buy partial ownership of the company at its
current valuation.  So, in theory, the company becomes worth a lot more in some
years and you have the ability to buy a share of the company for the same price
that you'd pay today. You exercise the option to buy shares at the old price,
then sell those shares at the new price. In theory, you make a profit.

The reality is much more complicated. Here's why.

  0. **Vesting schedule:** You're never given the options outright when you're
  hired. Your options have to "vest" first. This means you have to put in the
  time to earn your options. Otherwise people could hop from company to company
  and accumulate stock options at companies they barely worked at. Typically
  none of your options will vest the first year, then some portion of your
  options will vest every year that you stick around.  If you leave your job
  within a year, you get nothing out of your stock option grant.
  0. **No liquidity event:** Before the company goes public, you can't sell
  your options to just anyone. Even if your company's valuation goes up and you
  stay around long enough to vest your options, you still need to find a buyer
  for your stock. You'll need to find someone who:
      * Wants to invest in your company,
      * Has the special accreditation required to buy stock in a non-public company,
      * Is approved by your company's board of directors. Your options usually
        come with string attached that prevent you from selling shares of the
        company without their approval. They don't want you selling shares to
        the competition.
      * These contraints mean your shares are hard to sell, so others are less
        likely to want them. You only really get to sell them if your company goes
        public or gets acquired. Both are very rare. Keep in mind that if your
        company gets acquired for less than it was once worth, you're better off
        not exercising your options at all.
  0. **You can always ask for options later:** Once you're on the inside, you'll
     be in a better position to decide whether you want to stay with the
     company and bet your luck on its future. If that's the case, you can
     always negotiate to get some stock options when the time comes for a raise.
