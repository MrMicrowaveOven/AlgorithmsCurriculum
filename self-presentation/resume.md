# Preparing your Resume
* Your résumé is your best shot at proving you're not a yahoo.
* What's on there makes a big difference.
* What's not on there, and how you lay everything out, makes an equally big difference.

No one likes opening Word documents. When your résumé is done, export it to PDF.


# Layout
* ONE PAGE ONLY
* Lots and lots of whitespace


# Content
* Have a high bar for what goes on your résumé:
	* Ask yourself: would I score points for talking about this more than 5 minutes during an interview?
	* If the answer is no, leave it out.


## Relevant Links
* Github
* Portfolio
* LinkedIn

Bonus (if they're good):
* Tumblr
* Twitter

## Technical
* List your past projects and the technologies you used.
* For each project, highlight one cool feature.
	* Even better: summarize a problem you encountered and solved.
* Look up how to spell and capitalize the technologies you mention.

## Work
Unless you worked as a web developer, this section is mainly to prove one thing:
I am a functional member of society.


Things to LEAVE OUT:

* Service jobs that paid the bills (waiter, grocery clerk, library assistant...).
* Jobs or internships having nothing to do with computers or the web.

Things to INCLUDE:

* Jobs where the web or some other computer technology was involved (eg. QA Tester).
   * Highlight a time when you taught yourself something technical on the job.
* Jobs where number-crunching was involved (analyst-type roles)

## Education
* Don't mention App Academy
* It's totally cool to leave out this section if you don't have a college degree.

## Personal
Only include this section if:
* You have a lot of whitespace.
* You have smart-person hobbies or talents (like chess).
