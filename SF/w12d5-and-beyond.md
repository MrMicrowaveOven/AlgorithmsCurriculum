# W12D5 and BEYOND

## W12D5
* Mock interviews @ 9am
* Continue applying to 10 companies per day and adding 10 to jobberwocky.
    * Start applying to the the companies you've marked as 2s and 1s.
* Sign up for the [ongoing mock interview group][pairboarding]. This group meets weekly and is a way for job seekers to continue practicing pairboarding, behavioral questions, and other interview skills.

### Coding Challenge
* Given by one of a/A's hiring partners.
* Optional, but good practice for future coding challenges.
* The best results are passed directly on to the company.


## And beyond
* There may be additional lectures next week. Some may be required.
* Come in by 10am every day until you are excused by your career coach.  
* Even after being excused, continue coming back.  Students that search from the office have a better work environment and find jobs faster.
* Continue applying to 10 places and adding 10 companies to Jobberwocky every weekday. Not applying will result in strikes.
* If you finish the a/A mock interview problems
    * Practice [these tests][algo-specs]
    * Try [Codility][codility]
    * Find online algorithms lectures or see this [Coursera course][Coursera].
* Learn about [architecture, scalability][hiredintech] and [systems design][systemsdesign].
* After you hit 150 applications, talk to your coach about whether you may be removed from roll call.
