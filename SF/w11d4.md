# W11D4
* Algorithms office hours 9a-10a
* Mock interviews today at 10:30a
* Continue adding companies to Jobberwocky
* Algorithms lecture at 4:30.

## START APPLYING!!
  * **Once you have been cleared by your coach until you get a job, aim to apply to 10 companies from your companies list every weekday**.  
    * This will take 3-7hours/day.
    * Apply only to 3s for your first ~80 applications. Then start with 2s and 1s.
    * If you send <40 applications in a week, you'll be assessed 1 strike. If you send <25, you'll be assessed 2 strikes. The week ends Monday morning at 9am.
  * **Add every application into the Jobberwocky**. Update whether you've done a pre-onsite, interviewed, got rejected, or got an offer.
    * pre-onsite: a phone screen or take-home problem or both
    * interviewed: refers to an on-site, in-person interview
  * **You will be on roll call until you submit 150 applications.** It's prohibitively difficult for us to support students who are struggling with the job search if they stop coming in.  Students that have sent 150 applications are also encouraged to come in.  Students that job hunt from the office get more help and find jobs faster.
