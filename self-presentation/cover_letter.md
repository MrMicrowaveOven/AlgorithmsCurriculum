# Foreword

**Don't necessarily advertise App Academy**

Many companies underestimate how selective App Academy is and what an accomplishment it is to complete the course. Meanwhile employers don't like to feel flooded by candidates with the same profile. There is also a lingering suspicion among old school engineers that a graduate from a programming course is not "one of them".

If your résumé feels light, go ahead and list App Academy under your education. If you've done other things that are ostensibly more impressive however, feel free to omit App Academy (in your cover letter, portfolio, LinkedIn, etc.). Most students could go either way on this, but you should know it's an option and past graduates have taken it.

On the other hand interviewers might ask you where you learned to code. At that point you want to give the full story. Mention App Academy, as well as Code Academy, Effective JavaScript, Chris Pine, Ruby Monk, and whatever other resources you used.

**Don't Call Yourself 'Full Stack'**

App Academy trained you in the full stack, but calling yourself a 'full stack engineer' is a little premature. 'Full stack' often means "so experienced I can build whatever you throw at me". For now just call yourself a web developer. Make it clear you are very strong in both Rails and JavaScript.


# Cover Letter

Do not sweat the cover letter. Some HR people (very few) take off points if you don't have one attached to your application. Most HR people do not read your cover letter because they all say the same thing anyway. The point is just to have one.

Do not try to make an impression with fancy words and formalities. Antipattern: "Hence I believe I am uniquely positioned to thrive in the challenging environment your company provides."

There are subtler ways to make your cover letter stand out. The good news is they also scale well for sending out many job applications.

Build a template with these classy touches:

* Have a minimally styled header that includes your contact information.
* Below that insert the date.
* Below that insert the name / title / company name / work address of the person you're writing to.

Here's an [example][example-cover-letter] of some cool templating. Note that this letter is about two times longer than yours needs to be and the language is way too flowery. Use a neutral sign off like "Best Regards" or "All the Best".

# Cover Letter Template

Keep the language causual. Make it more formal if the company seems less laid back (especially if they're based in New York). If you are applying to a specific role, say so in the first sentence. Otherwise don't bother to begin with "I'm writing to apply to your company" since that should already be clear from you subject line.

Cover the following points, not necessarily in this order:
* Why are you writing? (Indicate the relevant position directly in the subject line. Don't open with "I am writing to apply for...".)
* What are your skills?
* What is your background (if it is relevant)?
* What kind of company do you want to join? (Keep it generic.)
* What about this company matches that? (The one sentence you might change for each application.)
* Mention the materials you're sending along (résumé + github + one or two live links).


 Addressing the letter when you don't know the name of the person reading it:
* Use *"Hello [company] team"* if they're a laidback company.
* Use *"Dear Sir or Madam"* if they seem stiff.

# Emailing like a boss

**Etiquette**

Some companies don't provide exact instructions on how to apply. If that's the case and you're applying via email, include your cover letter and résumé as attachments and also paste your cover letter in the body of the email.

The subject line is just to find your email in an crowded inbox. "Junior Rails Engineer - San Francisco" is more helpful than "Applying to CoolCompany, inc".

**Signatures**

Set up a signature with your mail client. Include the link to your portfolio site.

You could try something like this:

    Best,
    
    Mark Zuckerberg
    markzuckerberg.com
    @finkd
