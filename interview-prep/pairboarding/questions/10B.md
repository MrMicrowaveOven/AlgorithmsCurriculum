## `max_unique_psub`

Let's define a **pseudo-substring**: `psub` is a pseudo-substring of
`str` if there exists some `[i_0, i_1, ..., i_n]` such that (a) `i_l <
i_m` for `l < m` and (b) `psub[l] == str[i_l]`. For example:

```
"abc" is a psub of "abcdef"
"ace" is a psub of "abcdef"
"cdf" is a psub of "abcdef"

"fed" is _not_ a psub of "abcdef" (letters are out of order)
```

Next, recall the definition of **lexicographical order**: `str1 >
str2` if (a) `str1 != str2` and either (b1) `str2` is a prefix of
`str1` or (b2) at the first position at which `str1` and `str2`,
`str1[i] > str2[i]`.

Given a string `str`, find the lexicographical greatest
psubstring. Additionally, disregard all psubstrings which repeat
letters (a letters may appear multiple times in `str`).

```ruby
require 'set'

# O(nlog(n))
def max_unique_psub(str)
  # sort larger letters first, breaking ties by using leftmost letters
  # first.
  letter_positions = str
    .each_with_index.to_a
    .sort_by { |letter, pos| [-letter.ord, pos] }

  used_letters = Set.new
  psub = ""
  cur_position = -1
  letter_positions.each do |letter, pos|
    # psub must be appear in `str` left-to-right
    next if pos < cur_position
    # psub must not repeat letters
    next if used_letters.include?(letter)

    psub << letter
    used_letters << psub
    cur_position = pos
  end

  psub
end
```
