# Curating Your Github

## Delete and format
* Delete most of your repositories.
    * Delete the very early ones.
    * Delete incomplete projects.
    * Delete the mini Rails apps, except if you did something cool with them, like nesting comments in Reddit.
* Rename the repos that you keep.
    * Give them enticing descriptions and useful ReadMe's.
    * If your code is crowded with lines you'd commented out while trying something different, make sure to remove those.
    * Do this in your browser so that their last commit is from you and not 'App Academy Student'.

## Cool Repos to Keep
* ActiveRecord Lite
* Rails Lite
* Asteroids
* Snake
* Tic-Tac-Toe & Tower of Hanoi
* Ruby recursion exercizes (if they're complete)
* BFS, DFS, Knight's Travails, 8 Queens, Word Chains

In the post-course curriculum you will learn about data structures and algorithms.
You will implement linked lists, binary trees, hashes, etc. in Ruby.
These implementations are actually rare in Ruby, so these are cool things to have.
Keep them in explicitely named repos, eg. "Ruby Linked List". Employers will <3.
