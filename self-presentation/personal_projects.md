# Personal Projects

**As soon as a project becomes so big you can't make visible improvements to it under an hour, stop working on it.**

 First do:
* Set up [Pingdom][pingdom].
* Populate a demo login if your app has authentication.
    * **Make it very easy for employers to find the demo login details.**
    * You can put login details on your résumé & portfolio.
    * Or you can add a button on your login page that fills the username and password fields with the details.
* Remove unneeded lines of code that you had left commented-out.
    
 Then do:
* Write some tests for your app with RSpec.
    * RSpec can come up in interviews so it's important to practice.
    * Many employers love to see tests in your Github.
* Improve the styling and positioning, eg. with [Twitter Bootstrap][bootsrap].
* Set up [Omniauth][omniauth].
