Best ways to get good at it, in order:
* Do a lot of interviews,
* Practice, with a life-like setting,
* Think about how you can do better.

This workshop does the latter.

## General Tips

0. Talk
  * If you're stuck on something, explain what you're stuck on.
  * Explain each step, ideally before you start it so your interviewer
    can offer tips if he/she feels like it.
  * Don't allow long silences. If you have to, explain what you're about
    to ponder.
  * (To sympathize with your interviewer, think of your reaction when
    your computer takes a minute to process something without showing a
progress bar.)
0. Be a little anal
  * Don't stop until they tell you to. If you get to
  a solution
     0. optimize the time and space efficiency,
     0. improve the code style, make it more concise.
  * Write things down: you don't lose points for doing calculations on
    the board, even if it's "easy math". No one will fault you for being
clear.
  * Start with a roadmap so you don't miss an exit.
0. Engage
  * Smile, take interest in the problem.
  * Write from the top left of the board.
  * Say "we".
  * Prefer whiteboard over paper so that you and the interviewer
   are facing the same direction.

## First Steps

* Reformulate the problem to
  0. make sure you understand the problem,
  0. internalize the problem,
  0. start thinking about how to abstract it.
* Ask clarifying questions about the input. For example, if the function takes an array of numbers. Are they just any numbers? Peopleâ€™s ages, ie. integers between 0 and 130? Temperatures, ie. floats between -459.67 10**32?
* Process two or three easy cases on board to build an intuition.
* Build and explain your roadmap.

## Break down and simplify

Break down: "The core of the solution will be one function that does this,
another that does that, and a third that does something else."

Simplify: "Let's assume for now that the cow is spherical."

## Own the problem

* Use the top right of the board for notes.
  * to manage your roadmap,
  * to keep track of future optimizations you might make,
  * to note problems you anticipate that aren't immediately relevant.
* Postpone the trivial parts.
  * It's ok to assume that you have a helper method as long as you
    promise to get back to it later.
* Manage the scope.
  * Start with a dumbed-down version of the problem (ie. simplify).
  * If the problem has ambiguous scope, pick the easiest version and
    tell the interviewer you'll generalize your solution to show you're
aware of the trickier scope.
* Offer your opinion on tradeoffs.
   * Noticing that there are several possibilities is good. Asking the
     interviewer which they favor is ok.
   * Offering your own take on it is even better.
