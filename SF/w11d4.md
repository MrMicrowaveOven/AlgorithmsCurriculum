* Continue mock interviewing and adding companies to Jobberwocky.

## Negotiations
* Read about [negotiating an offer][offer-negotiation].
* Get some data points for [salary negotiations][salary-data].
* You can also check out this [HackerNewsarticle][hn-negotiation-article]

## START APPLYING!!
  * **From now on until you get a job, apply to 10 companies from your companies list every weekday**.  
    * This will take 3-7hours/day.
    * Apply only to 3s for your first 80 applications. Then start with 2s and 1s.
  * **Add every application into the Jobberwocky**. Update whether you've done a pre-onsite, interviewed, got rejected, or got an offer.
    * pre-onsite: a phone screen or take-home problem or both
    * interviewed: refers to an on-site, in-person interview
  * **Also BCC every application you send to ja@appacademy.io**. (Short for job applications. We abbreviated it in case you mess up and CC us instead of BCC). Like in the Applyathons, send us screenshots if it's a non-email application. AngelList screenshots are also okay. One application per e-mail! We'll be using these to confirm your applications.
  * **You are required to continue coming in to App Academy until you submit your first 100 applications.** We ask this because it's prohibitively difficult for us to support students who are struggling with their job search if they stop coming in.
