## Introduction 

Walk me through your background.

**NB**: this is your cue to do your personal pitch.

## Initiativityness

Tell me about a time when you took initiative. 

- Summarize the project you took initiative on 
- Describe what you did -- be concise, but give just enough detail so that your interviewer (who just met you) can follow easily
- What was the result?  How was the project/situation improved because of your actions?

## `common_substrings`

Write a function, `common_substrings(str1, str2)` that takes two
strings and returns the longest common substring.

```ruby
def common_substrings(str1, str2)
  longest_substring = ""

  start_idx = 0
  while start_idx < str1.length
    # don't consider substrings that would be too short to beat
    # current max.
    len = longest_substring.length + 1

    while (start_idx + len) <= str1.length
      end_idx = start_idx + len
      substring = str1[start_idx...end_idx]
      longest_substring = substring if str2.include?(substring)

      len += 1
    end

    start_idx += 1
  end

  longest_substring
end
```

This runs in `O(m * n**2)` time.

## `sum_rec`

Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns their
sum. Use recursion.

```ruby
def sum_rec(nums)
  return 0 if nums.empty?
  nums[0] + sum_rec(nums.drop(1))
end
```
