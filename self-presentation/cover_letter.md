## Foreword

**What are cover letters for?**

Many people will tell you that they rarely read applicants' cover letters and
that cover letters are therefore useless. The first part might be true but the
second part doesn't necessarily follow. Whether I read the cover letter or not,
I'll notice that a candidate included one, maybe quickly scan it for some
keywords, and then look at their resume and other application materials.
Finally, I'll make a decision to contact them or not. A cover letter means
the candidate is a little more serious than a candidate who didn't include a
cover letter (all other things being equal). Further, while scanning the cover
letter, I might have picked up on some keywords ("Rails", "fast-paced",
"team"...) that suggest this candidate knows what they're doing. That makes them
slightly harder to ignore.

What does this mean for you? Your cover letter shouldn't be Shakespeare. Merely
existing is 90% of its job. The other 10% is including the right keywords and keeping 'fluff' to a minimum.

## Content

**No But's**

* "I don't have much experience, but I can learn very fast."
* "I don't have a CS degree, but I built a lot of cool stuff."

All a recruiter reads is "I don't have much experience, I don't have a CS
degree". Cover letters are meant to sell you. Only include positive details
about yourself. Let the recruiter do their job and find out whatever answers
about you they care about.

**Don't Call Yourself 'Full Stack'**

App Academy trained you in the full stack, but calling yourself a 'full stack
engineer' in your cover letter is a little premature. 'Full stack' often means "so experienced I can
build whatever you throw at me". For now just call yourself a web developer.
Make it clear you are very strong in both Rails and JavaScript.  

The one exception to this is in the Projects section of your resume.  There, you use the term 'full stack' to signal to the reader that you built both the front- and back-end for your capstone project.  

**No Fancy Words**

Do not try to make an impression with fancy words and formalities. Antipattern:
"Hence I believe I am uniquely positioned to thrive in the challenging
environment your company provides." can be refactored to this: "I like the challenging environment at [Company]."

There are subtler ways to make your cover letter stand out. The good news is
they also scale well for sending out many job applications.

**Touch of Class**

Build a template with these classy touches:

* Have a minimally styled header that includes your contact information - should be the same as for your resume.
* Below that insert the date.


## Cover Letter Template

**Opening**

Start off strong with a "I am a web developer with experience in X, Y and Z". Do not open with "I would like to apply to the Ruby developer position listed on your website". That's boring.  After that, you may include a sentence that says that you're looking for a job.  See the [example cover letters][cover letters] for formats that have worked for others.  

**Company-specific Blurb**

Somewhere in your letter write two sentences about the company and why you want
to work there. Don't sell them on generic excitement about how awesome the team
is. That's only convincing if you've actually met people there or visited their office. Instead, the message
you should get across, is that you might be a fit for their particular industry or role. Show how their industry appeals to you and/or how you can handle their specific challenges.  If you spend  
five minutes on a job application, four of those should be for scanning the
Wikipedia article about the industry they're in and the company website and
picking out buzzwords.

Consider these examples:

*Show knowledge of the industry*
* Weak: "I am excited to apply to GeneriCo because we both value high quality code and making awesome products."  
* Strong: "A cloud-based point of sale allows businesses to centralize their transaction data like never before.  I would love to help build GeneriCo's product and finally bring retail to the cloud."

*Show understanding of their challenges*
* Weak: "I enjoy shopping online and especially like it when the experience is streamlined like on your site."  
* Strong: "GeneriCo's userbase is growing fast.  I've dealt with scaling databases and leveraged my mathematics background to develop faster algorithms that enabled further growth."

If two different ways to write blurbs feels overwhelming, just use the first method for all the blurbs.  

**Talking Points**

Cover the following points, not necessarily in this order:

* What are your skills?
* What is your background (if it is relevant)?
* What kind of company do you want to join? (Keep this part generic.)
* What about this company matches that? (This is the one sentence you might
  change for each application.)
* Mention the materials you're sending along: résumé + github + link to a live
  project.
* Tell them why that live project is cool.

Addressing the letter when you don't know the name of the person reading it:

* Use *"Hello [company] team"* if they're a laidback company.
* Use *"Dear Sir or Madam"* if they seem stiff.

**Note** 
Don't include your life history in your cover letter.  Recruiters want to know your skills and qualifications first, and will ask about your story when they get you on the phone.  Save your story for your personal pitch.

# Emailing like a boss

**Etiquette**

Some companies don't provide exact instructions on how to apply. If that's the
case and you're applying via email, include your cover letter and résumé as
attachments and also paste your cover letter in the body of the email.

The subject line is just to find your email in an crowded inbox. "Junior Rails
Engineer - San Francisco" is more helpful than "Applying to CoolCompany, inc".

**Signatures**

Set up a signature with your mail client. Include the link to your portfolio site.

You could try something like this:

    Mark Zuckerberg
    markzuckerberg.com
    @finkd
