# Pitfalls of the job search

## I am not worthy
* Story of Ned
* You're interviewing them
* First 5 interviews are *practice*

## I just want a job
* Right now you can't imagine not enjoying your next job.
* You're thinking: I'll get a job, finally be a normal person in SF, go
  to bars, museums, hang out. How could it possibly not work out?
* Think about the job you'll be doing, day in and day out.
* You are worth a lot to the company
* The offer curve:
  * earlier offers come from smaller companies
  * you get better at interviews

## They'll hire me if I code more
* Your job search is a marketing problem, not an engineering problem.
* 225 Applications in 3 weeks => 15 apps / day avg.
* Hackathons > personal projects

## Recruiters
* Not your friend
* Keep them in the dark
  * About your salary range
  * About where you're applying

## Be prepared:
* They will reject you
* They will ask you salary requirements
* They will say they're taking a chance on you
* They will promise future riches
* They will want you to decide on the spot
* Recruiters will ask where else you're applying
