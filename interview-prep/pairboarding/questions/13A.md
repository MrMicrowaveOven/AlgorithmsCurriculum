**Write a method to generate a random integer between 1 and 7, given a method that generates a random integer between 1 and 5. The distribution between each of the numbers must be uniform.**

  ```ruby
    [given rand5]
    def rand7
        while true 
            num = 5 * (rand5 - 1) + rand5
            num < 22 ? return (num % 7 + 1) : nil
        end
    end
  ```
  

**You have two sticks and matchbox. Each stick takes exactly an hour to burn from one end to the other. The sticks are not identical and do not burn at a constant rate. As a result, two equal lengths of the stick would not necessarily burn in the same amount of time.  How would you measure exactly 45 minutes by burning these sticks?**

Since the sticks do not burn at a constant rate, we can not use the length of the stick as any sort of measurement of time. If we light a stick, it takes 60 minutes to burn completely. What if we light the stick from both sides? It will take exactly half the original time, i.e. 30 minutes to burn completely.

0 minutes – Light stick 1 on both sides and stick 2 on one side.
30 minutes – Stick 1 will be burnt out. Light the other end of stick 2.
45 minutes – Stick 2 will be burnt out.
