## W12D5 and BEYOND

W12D5
* Take the official coding test from one of App Academy's hiring partners.
* Attend the Financial Planning lecture this afternoon.  (optional but highly recommended, especially for those that have been working for less than 3 years or have had less than 2 full time jobs)
* Sign up for the [weekly ongoing mock interview group][pairboarding].  Even if you're not sure you'll join, sign up to get the announcements.  Your interview skills will thank you.  

And beyond
* You are required to come into the office by 10am every day until you are excused by your career coach.  
* Even after being excused, continue coming back to a/A.  Students that come into the office benefit from a better work environment, help from a/A staff, and a supportive community.
* **Continue applying to 10 places and adding 15 companies to your Job Search Roadmap every weekday.** Not applying to enough companies can result in strikes or other consequences.  
* There may be additional lectures from a/A staff and alumni. Some may be required. 
* Remember, if you finish the a/A mock interview problems,
    * Stay sharp using [these tests][algo-specs] after you get through the mock interview questions.
    * Try [Codility][codility] if you want to do more on your own.
* Learn about [architecture, scalability][hiredintech] and [systems design][systemsdesign].
* After you hit 100 applications, talk to your coach about whether you may be removed from roll call.
