## Capstone
* We'll do another round of peer reviews on Monday.
* Make sure you have a custom domain and your dyno stays awake.
* If you haven't crafted a README for your capstone project, do so now. [See examples.][readme]

## Other Materials
* If you have time you can get a head start on your [Resume][resume] and [Cover Letter][cover-letter].
