## `binary_ones`

Write a function that takes an integer and returns the occurence of 1s
in its binary form, without the intermediate step of finding the
actual binary form.

Find the nearest integer below the input number that is expressible in
base 2. There will be a one in the binary form for each integer that's
between the nearest base and the input number.

```ruby
def binary_ones(num)
  if Math.log2(num) == Math.log2(num).to_i
    1
  else
    nearest_base = nearest_base(num)
    difference_to_base = num - nearest_base
    return 1 + binary_ones(difference_to_base)
  end
end

def nearest_base(num)
  i = 0
  i += 1 until 2 ** i > num
  2 ** (i - 1)
end
```
