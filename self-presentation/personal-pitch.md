# Prepare your Pitch

"So, tell me about yourself. What have you done in your career and what brought you here?"

Unnatural as it feels, this formality will likely be the first question you get in an interview.  Since your answer will also be longer than most parts of the conversation, your interviewer is likely to sit back, listen to you talk, and decide whether to take your candidacy serioiusly.  Depending on your interviewer, this can significantly affect the outcome of the entire conversation.  

If you're good at selling yourself, this is where you shine. Otherwise no worries. A 1 minute, well-rehearsed spiel is all you need to sound prepared and professional.

## Brainstorming

Before crafting your pitch, ask yourself these questions:

* When did you write your first line of code? Writing BASIC functions on your TI graphing calculator in middle school counts. Thatâ€™s how a lot of successful programmers got started.
* Why did you choose to major in X?
* How did you decide on web development?
* How do your major and web development relate in your mind (Get creative)
* What online resources did you use before applying to App Academy?

## Your 60-second life's story

Your life story should be just that -- *a story.*  It should have a beginning, middle, and end.  Each piece should be concrete and specific.  Start with one of the first times you encountered code (or some type of problem solving that is tech-related).  Then describe your transition into web development.  At the end, bring your listener to the present: you are a trained web developer ready to start working for their company.  

 A sample outline for your inspiration:
(beginning)
* *Beginning:* "In college I chose to major in [...] and took a lot of classes in [...] because I like working on problems that involve [...].  At [company] I accomplished [...] and [...]. While I was at it I learned [...]."
* *Middle:* "I've always had an affinity for computers so I taught myself HTML and JavaScript for fun.  When I picked up Ruby two years ago, I immediately got hooked.  I was playing around on Ruby Monk every day after work.  I wanted to take it to the next level so I took some classes."
    * Bring up App Academy if they ask for details. Also mention online courses like Coursera, Ruby Monk, etc.
* *End:* "I've now built two games in Javascript and one full-stack web app using Bootstrap and Rails.  I want to join [company] because [...]."

Notice that each part of the story includes specific details such as time/place, projects, and accomplishments.  A few specifics are critical for your listener to fully undestand your story.  

## Behavioral Questions

Behavioral questions are a type of interview question that ask about specific situations from your past.  For example "Tell me about a time you dealt with an interpersonal issue" is a behavioral question.  The interviewer is trying to get a picture of how you handle yourself at a job.   

Answers to behavioral questions should also take the form of a story.  Remember to include specifics about time/place. The story should begin with a problem, then describe actions you took, and end with a result. Together, this should take about 30 seconds.  
* Problem - the situation that required support or intervention
* Action - what you did to address the problem
* Result - the improved situation produced through your actions

An example for the question "Tell me about a time you took initiative to do improve something."  
* *Problem:* "When I was at ABC company, we kept all our data on spreadsheets.  There were so many, the sheets were almost impossible to keep updated.  And when I tried to find information for a client, it sometimes took me 30 minutes to find the numbers I needed."
* *Action:* "I started researching better ways to store data, and found a number of database options online. I researched three different options, discussed each with my manager, and ultimately chose Salesforce as the best fit for us." 
* *Result:* "I worked with our office manager to get the system set up, and two months later, we not only had cleaner data that was easier to update, but were able to keep track of almost twice as many metrics as we were before."  

Answers to these questions can come from your work history, academic projects, or even personal projects.  

Other behavioral questions include:
* What do you consider your greatest career accomplishment? 
* Tell me about a time you dealt with an interpersonal issue. 
* What was the hardest problem your ran into in the job?
* Tell me about a time you had to teach yourself something in order to reach your goal.  
* Tell me about the most difficult challenge you encountered on that software project.  


## Other questions

A well rehearsed responses to these common questions will help you stand out.  

* How did you hear about us?
* Why do you want to work at our company?
* Why do you want to be a programmer?
* Where do you see yourself five years down the road?
* How did you teach yourself to program?
    * Here it makes sense to bring up App Academy.
* How do you go about picking up a new technology?
* What kinds of problems do you like to work on?
* What was the hardest coding project you ever did?
* What work have you done that you are most proud of?

Some questions can be related to coding
* What do you like about Ruby?
    * Common answers: readable, object-oriented
* What do you like about Rails?
    * Common answer: "convention over configuration"
* Walk me through your development process for a new project.
    * Pro moves: mapping out database relations, listing specifications for the controllers, writing tests, sketching out the views...
* What's your favorite algorithm?
* What's your favorite data structure? 
* What's your favorite Ruby gem (other than Rails)?


## Prep time!

This week's lecture and workshops will help you prepare for these parts of an interview.  You can also practice on your own. The more you practice, the better you'll perform.

Outline your 60-second life story following the model above.  Find the student you paired with on W1D1 of App Academy. Pick a famous tech company and ask them the big questions:

* "Tell me about yourself. What have you done in your career and why do you want to work at [famous company]?"
* Why do you want to be a programmer?
* How did you teach yourself to program?

Then rotate, give each other feedback, and do it all again once more.

This will help you sound a lot more professional at your interview. On top of this, you can observe your interviewer and build a connection more easily if you're not trying to come up with answers on the spot.
