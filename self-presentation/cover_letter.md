# Cover Letter

Maybe there is one crazy HR person out there that will read your cover letter closely. They will find your pitch unsatisfactory and move on to the next candidate. Then they will find that candidate's pitch too weak, and move on to the next. And to the next. And the next. This will go on until they've selected only the applicants who have a poor sense of time management. Those people will fit right into the company culture.

In other words do not sweat the cover letter.

Do not try to make an impression with fancy words and formalities. Antipattern: "Hence I believe I am uniquely positioned to thrive in the challenging environment your company provides."

There are subtler ways to make your cover letter stand out. The good news is they scale.

Build a template with these classy touches:

* Have a minimally styled header that includes your contact information.
* Below that insert the date
* Below that insert the name / title / company name / work address of the person you're writing to

Here's an [example][example-cover-letter] of some cool templating. Note that this letter is much longer than yours needs to be and the language is way too flowery. Use a neutral sign off like "Best Regards" or "All the Best".

# Applying like a boss

Some companies don't provide exact instructions on how to apply. If that's the case and you're applying via email, include your cover letter and résumé as attachments and paste your cover letter in the body of the email.

The subject line is just to find your email in an crowded inbox. "Rails Engineer - San Francisco" is much better than "Applying to CoolCompany, inc".

**Use this as an inspiration. Do not copy it word for word.**

*The language is intentionally casual. Make it more formal if the company seems less laid back (especially if they're based in New York).*

    Hi Joe,

    I'm writing to apply to the Rails Engineer opening at CoolCo. I am a web developer experienced with Rails and JavaScript.
    
    I'm currently looking for opportunities to join a team that's building an awesome product
    and solving hard problems. CoolCo's online cat rental agency sounds like a great combination of the two.
    I would love to connect to talk more about your product and the engineering profile you're looking for.

    My résumé is attached for your convenience. You can also read some of my past code here www.github.com/markzuckerberg.
    I look forward to being in touch.
    
    Best,
    
    Mark Zuckerberg


# Emailing like a boss

**Etiquette**

Some companies don't provide exact instructions on how to apply. If that's the case and you're applying via email, include your cover letter and résumé as attachments and also paste your cover letter in the body of the email.

The subject line is just to find your email in an crowded inbox. "Junior Rails Engineer - San Francisco" is much better than "Applying to CoolCompany, inc".

**Signatures**

Set up a signature with your mail client. Include the link to your portfolio site.

You could try something like this:
