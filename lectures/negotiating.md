# Reasons to Negotiate
* Opportunity cost
* Be valued and invested in
* For the company: don't get poached

# Internal Structures: HR vs. Tech
CEO, C-suite
=> HR: stay under budget
=> Engineering: get the best people possible

# Employers:
* They will reject you
* They will ask you salary requirements
* They will say they're taking a chance on you
* They will promise future riches
* They will want you to decide on the spot

# Recruiters
* Keep them in the dark
  * About your salary range
  * About where you're applying

# Pre-Offer negotiations
Don't talk salary until they make you an offer. If they insist, say
  * I just want fair market value.
  * I trust that [company]'s offer will be in that range.

If they insist on a number, say
  * [company] is probably better positioned to know what fair market value is.
  * I found [these numbers][salary-data] on Indeed and Robert Half.
  * Those are just two data points so I'm not sure how reliable they are.

# Game plan
 * **ASK FOR TWO WEEKS**
 * Contact all previous companies
 * Let me know
 * If they push for less wait time, you get to ask for more.
 * If they don't, you get to look for competing offers.

# Assembling a package
* Full-time vs. Part-time
* Base
* Benefits
* Bonus 
* New computer
* PTO: set or unlimited
* Terms
* Options

# How to value options
