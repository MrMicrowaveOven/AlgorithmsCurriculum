# Browser Game

This portfolio piece is going to be to impress non-technical HR screeners. They won't know any of what's going on under the hood - they just care about seeing something pretty on the screen. The prettier and more user-friendly it is, the more impressive it'll be to them.

Don't use Asteroids or Snake. These are games that many resume screeners have seen time and time again, so if you want to get past a resume screen, you need to choose something unique and original. It doesn't have to be an obscure game by any means; in fact, you should prefer something recognizable to many people (definitely don't invent your own game).

You'll want to personalize it and make it pretty. Your game should be at should be at least as impressive (technically) as Asteroids or Snake (so something like TicTacToe or Towers of Hanoi is not complex enough).

If you're feeling ambitious (and have plenty of time), you may want to use a library like [Phaser][phaser]. But if you want to build something simpler (which is often a good idea), you may just want to use vanilla JS and/or Canvas.

Here are the checklists of what your game should have:

### Repo
* README
  * Link to live
  * Instructions/how to play
  * List of techs/languages/plugins/APIs used
  * Technical implementation details for anything worth mentioning
    * Basically anything you had to stop and think about before building
    * Links to the code for these (make sure it looks good)
  * To-dos/future features
* No .DS_Stores
* Organize into /assets and /lib

### Live
* Has a landing page/modal with instructions
* Has a HUD (heads-up-display) with lives, score, level?
* Has a game-over modal that displays points, a replay button, and instructions/how to play
* Hosted from your portfolio site on GitHub pages
