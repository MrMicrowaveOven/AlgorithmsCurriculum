#Writing a README

**Every project on your resume needs a great ReadMe.**

ReadMe breakdown:
* Link to live site
* A couple sentences to describe the project
* Instructions/how to play (for games)
* How to run the code (for Ruby projects)
* List of techs/languages/plugins/APIs used
* Technical implementation details for anything worth mentioning
  * Basically anything you had to stop and think about before building
  * Snippets or links to see code for these (make sure it looks good)
* Screenshots of anything related that looks cool (make sure these link to the live site if applicable)
* To-dos/future features

Also,
* No .DS_Stores
* Organize into /assets and /lib

Use the [sample project production readme][samplereadme] as a general guide, but don't copy it exactly. This will hurt your chances of hearing back from companies.
