## `find_missing_number`

Assume an array of non-negative integers. A second array is formed by
shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random
element. Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the
second array. Do this in linear time with constant memory use.

```ruby
def find_missing_number(array1, array2)
  array1.reduce(:+) - array2.reduce(:+)
end
```

Time complexity: `O(n)`.

## `is_shuffle?`

Given three strings, return whether the third is an **interleaving**
of the first two. Interleaving means it only contains characters from
the other two, no more no less, and preserves their character
ordering. "dabecf" is an interleaving of "abc" and "def". Note that
the first two strings needn't be in alphabetical order like these.

You may assume that the first two strings do not contain any
characters in common.

```ruby
# time: O(n), space: O(1)
def is_shuffle(str1, str2, str3)
  return false unless str1.length + str2.length == str3.length

  idx1, idx2, idx3 = 0, 0, 0
  while idx3 < str3.length
    if str1[idx1] == str3[idx3]
      idx1 += 1
      idx3 += 1
    elsif str2[idx2] == str3[idx2]
      idx2 += 1
      idx3 += 1
    else
      return false
    end
  end

  true
end
```

Next, relax the assumption that the first two strings contain no
overlap. Analyze the time-complexity of your solution. You may wish to
view this problem recursively.

```ruby
# O(2**n): `str3.length == n + 1` requires twice the work of
# `str3.length == n`
def is_shuffle(str1, str2, str3)
  return str1.empty? && str2.empty? if str3.empty?

  if str1[0] == str3[0]
    return true if is_shuffle(str1[1..-1], str2, str3[1..-1])
  end

  if str2[0] == str3[0]
    return true if is_shuffle(str1, str2[1..-1], str3[1..-1])
  end

  false
end
```
