## Introduction

Tell me about yourself.

**NB**: this is your cue to do your personal pitch.  Assume you are applying to Lyft.  

## Epic Fail

What was your biggest failure?

The answer should tell the interviewer the following:

- What was the context for the situation that led to the failure?
- What lead up to the failure?
- What, specifically, was the failure?
- How did you recover from this failure?  What was the eventual outcome?

**NB**: don't discuss any situation in which you acted violently or extremely unprofessionally.  If your failure ended in you being fired, expelled, or dismissed, do not say this outright -- phrase it in a more neutral way ("I ended up leaving the company" rather than "I was fired from my job").  

## `matrix_region_sum`

Given a matrix of integers and coordinates of a rectangular region
within the matrix, find the sum of numbers falling inside the
rectangle.

```ruby
def matrix_region_sum(matrix, top_left_coords, bottom_right_coords)
  total_sum = 0

  (top_left_coords[0]..bottom_right_coords[0]).each do |row_idx|
    (top_left_coords[1]..bottom_right_coords[1]).each do |col_idx|
      total_sum += matrix[row_idx][col_idx]
    end
  end

  total_sum
end
```

Time complexity: `O(number of rows * number of columns)`. This is the
best possible because we have to add every one of the numbers in the
rectangle. Anything less would require us to skip numbers.

## `merge_sort`

Implement merge sort.

```ruby
def merge_sort(array)
  # already sorted
  return array if array.count < 2

  middle = array.count / 2
  left, right = array.take(middle), array.drop(middle)

  sorted_left, sorted_right = merge_sort(left), merge_sort(right)

  merge(sorted_left, sorted_right)
end

def merge(left, right)
  merged_array = []
  until left.empty? || right.empty?
    merged_array <<
      ((left.first < right.first) ? (left.shift) : (right.shift))
  end

  merged_array + left + right
end
```

Time complexity: `O(n*log(n))`.

```ruby
def merge(left, right)
  merged_array = []
  i, j = 0, 0
  until i == left.length || j == right.length
    if left[i] > right[j] 
      merged_array << right[j]
      j += 1
    else
      merged_array << left[i]
        i += 1
    end
  end
  merged_array + left.drop(i) + right.drop(j)
end
```

Time complexity for merge only: `O(n)`.
