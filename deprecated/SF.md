    * pre-onsite: a phone screen or take-home problem or both
    * interviewed: refers to an on-site, in-person interview
  * **Also BCC every application you send to ja@appacademy.io**. (Short for job applications. We abbreviated it in case you mess up and CC us instead of BCC). Like in the Applyathons, send us screenshots if it's a non-email application. AngelList screenshots are also okay. One application per e-mail! We'll be using these to confirm your applications.
  * **You are required to continue coming in to App Academy until you submit your first 100 applications.** We ask this because it's prohibitively difficult for us to support students who are struggling with their job search if they stop coming in.
  * Generally speaking, we urge all students to keep coming to App Academy until they have a job. If you come in, you'll be better able to learn from your peers and grow as a developer, stay focused on your job search, as well as take advantage of our resources. Please, please keep coming back! We're here to support you!
