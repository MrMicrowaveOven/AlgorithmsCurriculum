# Creating and Using Your AngelList Profile

[AngelList](https://angel.co) is a social networking site for startups and job seekers.  As with LinkedIn, you'll be able to browse companies and they'll be able to take a look at your qualifications.  The key differences between LinkedIn and AngelList are 1) AngelList is exclusively tech companies, and 2) you can easily apply to jobs directly through AngelList.  More on the second point later. 

### Elements of Your AngelList 

The Work Experience, Education, and Projects sections of AngelList can be directly copied over from your LinkedIn profile. Be sure to include screenshots of your projects in your AngelList profile -- GIF screenshots are especially cool.  You can use the same profile picture you do in your LinkedIn.

**Mini-Resume**

This is a short description of who you are.  Mention that you're a software developer.  Additionally, you can include the tools you're best at learning, what kind of company you're on the market for, and/or some personal details.  Examples: 

"*Software engineer, experienced in JavaScript and Ruby on Rails. Worked previously in film, non-profit, education, and agriculture. @Yale University '15*"

"*I am a web developer with a background in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript/React.js. 
Beyond code, I am a traveler, an archaeologist, and a lifelong learner.* "

**What I Do**

The "What I Do" section is almost an extension of your mini-resume.  It's your chance to elaborate (briefly) on your qualifications and interests.  You can include what you like about coding in general, the kinds of projects you like to work on, the tools you prefer to use, and/or other technical interests you have.   Examples: 

"*I love web development because I get to make beautiful and functional things. Every day I get to work across scales, from big-picture innovation to nuts-and-bolts problem solving.*

*I recently completed a 12 week course at App Academy, an intensive, full-stack web development program that focuses on Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and React.js.*"

"*I'm a current software engineer, former journalist, and sporadic blogger.*

*When I'm not working, I'm probably running, solving Sudokus, putting forth an honest effort at swing dancing, or embarrassing my mother with my karaoke habit.*

*I like puzzles, and that drew me to this field.*"


**Achievements**

AngelList asks you to describe "your greatest achievement".  Of course, they mean your greatest code-related achievement(s).  Some people use this space to give an overview of every project they've done.  Others describe their largest/best project in depth.  Either is fine.  Write in complete sentences and focus on the projects that showcase your most marketable skills (Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and/or React, as well as anything else you've picked up since a/A that you're proud of).  Examples:

"*My most recent application is DashboardAlpha (dbalpha.info) where I served as the product owner and full-stack engineer. It was a SeekingAlpha-inspired investment research dashboard that aggregated information and helped investors manage their thoughts on individual securities. I designed an algorithm to dynamically alter displayed content with varying window sizes. I also customized a Backbone.js library to query data from Yahoo! and used Ruby on Rails gems to access Google-search APIs to present updated information of all US stocks.*

*Another application that I built was Breakout.js., a game that challenges players to clear a brick field with a ball. I served as the front-end engineer and used HTML5 canvas to present a dynamic game display and utilized multiple event listeners to give users multiple control methods. I also leveraged CSS3 features to present a tabbed menu to display game information.*"

"*Highlights of my accomplishments:* 
  - *Sole developer of joglog.me, a full-stack exercise-tracking web application using React on a Rails backend* 
  - *Selected as primary sustaining engineer for module in Intel's newest production technology after 6 months on job* 
  - *Graduated with honors from Carnegie Mellon with a double major in engineering*"

**Skills**

On AngelList, your skill list should only include technical skills -- languages, libraries, frameworks, etc.  Don't include non-technical skills such as spoken/written languages, soft skills, etc.  Additionally, AngelList asks you to rate your proficiency with each skill.  Choose "Advanced" for any skills you learned and practiced regularly at App Academy.  Use your best judgment for other skills you may have picked up elsewhere.

**Services**

This section isn't necessary to fill out when you're looking for full-time work.  It's generally for folks who are offering specific kinds of on-demand work.  

**What I'm Looking For**

Of course you want to say here that you're in search of a full-time software development role, but try to make it a little less generic than that.  Are you seeking a company that has a positive social impact?  Are you looking for somewhere that will allow you to work with data analysis?  Whatever it is, say it here.  Examples:

"*I love solving challenging problems, especially the ones that relate to scaling and performance improvement. I'm currently looking for an opportunity to work as a Backend Software Engineer, in the SF Bay Area, that exposes me to such problems and hence allows me to grow as an engineer.*"

"*I want to be engulfed within a whirlwind of passionate people who are consumed by a desire to build something meaningful / beautiful / cool.*"

**Locations**

Include anywhere you're willing to work.  Don't include a location unless you'd seriously consider taking a job there.  Employers use location as a filter, so if you don't include your preferred location(s), you're in danger of not being seen by a lot of potential fits.

**Markets**

This isn't strictly necessary to fill out, especially as a newcomer to the field, but it's nice to have.  "Markets" includes things like social media, educational technology, biotechnology, etc.  

### Using AngelList 

**"I'm Interested!" vs. the Star**

Its title is misleading, but the "Yes, I'm Interested" button is actually a job application.  When you click this, congratulations!  You have applied for a job.  The **employer is notified** and will likely look at your profile.  You have the option of sending the employer a short note when you express interest, and you should always do this.  Rather than pasting in your entire cover letter, pare it down to 2-4 sentences about why you'd like to work at the company.  If the company is also interested in you, you'll receive an email letting you know that you have a match.  If the company doesn't message you directly, send them a follow-up reiterating your interest and qualifications.

If you like a job posting but aren't ready to apply, **do not** hit "I'm Interested".  Instead, star the company to save it for later.

**Who to Follow**

Start by following your classmates, TAs, and other people you know personally.  Much like Twitter, you can gain helpful information by following leaders in the tech community.  If you see a CEO, entrepeneur, or someone else who is a big name at a company you're interested in, follow that person -- you'll then get job recommendations at that company in your feed.

**References**

AngelList allows you to give references to your peers and to request references.  AngelList's rules for references are a little weird -- you can *give* a reference to anyone who you're following and who is also following you.  But you can only *request* references from people you have worked with in a professional capacity, not collaborators on projects or fellow students.  

If you previously worked in tech in some capacity and you have good references who are on AngelList, it's worth reaching out.  Be sure to mention that you're on the job market as a software developer.  Additionally, if you worked closely with a fellow App Academy student on a large project, you may want to give them a reference and request a reference from them (of course, you'll have to use some other means to make this request -- such as asking them in person :).
