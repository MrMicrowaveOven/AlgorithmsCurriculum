# Cover Letter

Maybe there is one crazy HR person out there that will read your cover letter closely. They will find your pitch unsatisfactory and move on to the next candidate. Then they will find that candidate's pitch too weak, and move on to the next. And to the next. And the next. This will go on until they've selected only the applicants who have a poor sense of time management. Those peolpe will fit right into the company culture.

In other words do not sweat the cover letter.

Do not try to make an impression with fancy words and formalities. Antipattern: "Hence I believe I am uniquely positioned to thrive in the challenging environment your company provides."

There are subtler ways to make your cover letter stand out. The good news is they scale.

Build a template with these classy touches:
    * Have a minimally styled header that includes your contact information.
    * Below that insert the date
    * Below that insert the name / title / company name / work address of the person you're writing to

Here's an [example][example-cover-letter] of some cool templating.

Note that this letter is much longer than yours needs to be and the language is way too flowery. Use a neutral sign off like "Best Regards" or "All the Best".

# Sample Cover Letter

*The language here is intentionally casual. Definitely make it more formal if the company seems less laidback (especially if they're based in New York).*

    Hi [recruiter name || company name],

    I'm writing to apply to the [role] opening at [company name].
    I am a Rails developer with a strong command of Javascript.
    I'm currently looking for opportunities to join a team that's ["having a strong impact" / "building an awesome product"]
    and solving hard problems. [Company product] sounds like a great combination of the two.
    I would love to connect to talk more about your code and the engineering profile you're looking for.

    My résumé is attached for your convenience. You can also read some of my past code here [insert github link].
    I look forward to being in touch.
    
    Best,
    
    [my name]


# Emailing like a boss

**Etiquette**

Some companies don't provide exact instructions on how to apply. If that's the case and you're applying via email, include your cover letter and résumé as attachments and also paste your cover letter in the body of the email.

The subject line is just to find your email in an crowded inbox. "Junior Rails Engineer - San Francisco" is much better than "Applying to CoolCompany, inc".
