**Given an input stream of numbers, implement a function that would return a single number from the stream with an equal chance probability of being selected when compared with all other numbers in the stream. So, if the stream were 10 in size, any given number should have a 1 in 10 chance of being returned. Implement this in O(1) memory space (constant memory).**

The trick is a bit of math, and to start from the simplest case (see interviewing tips). Consider:

* If we had just one element in the stream, which would we return? The single element we have.
* If we now add a second element, which would we return? Either the one from the previous iteration, or the new one.
* How do we pick? We could just flip a coin. 50%-50%.
* Generalize from there.

  ```ruby
    def random(stream)
        number_stored = nil
        numbers_seen_so_far = 0
    
        stream.each do |el|
          numbers_sees_so_far += 1
    
          if Random.rand(numbers_seen_so_far) == 0 # returns a random integer that's less than the argument.
            number_stored = el
          end
        end
    
        number_stored
      end
  ```

**Given an array of arrays where the number of internal arrays is equal to the length of the internal arrays (ie a square grid), print the values of the array out in spiral order.**

  ```ruby
      def spiral(a)
        result = []
    
        until a.size == 0
          top = a.shift
          right = [*(0..a.size - 1)].map do |n|
            a[n].pop
          end 
    
          bottom = a.pop 
    
          left = [*(1..a.size - 1)].map do |n|
            a[n].shift
          end 
    
          result += top if top
          result += right if right
          result += bottom.reverse if bottom
          result += left.reverse if left
        end
    
        result
      end
  ```
