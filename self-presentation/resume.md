# Preparing your Resume
* Your résumé is your best shot at proving you're not a yahoo.
* What's on there makes a big difference.
* What's not on there, and how you lay everything out, makes an equally big difference.

No one likes opening Word documents. When your résumé is done, export it to a PDF.

Check out Gayle Laakmann McDowell's [model résumé][glm-resume]. At the bottom there's a template to make your own résumé too. Gayle Laakman McDowell is the author of [Cracking the Coding Interview][cracking-interview].

# Layout
* ONE PAGE ONLY
* Lots and lots of whitespace


# Content

In the world of people, having a diversity of interests and experiences is a beautiful thing. In the world of tech recruiting, expertise is much more valuable. Avoid letting your résumé suggest you were at one point unsure of what you wanted to do in life.
 
You don't want to leave out large chunks of time either. If you did one thing for over a year, include it. You knew what you wanted, but then you changed your mind. In this case, be ready to have a very good answer for anyone who asks you why you changed your mind.

 Use this bar for what goes on your résumé:
* Ask yourself: would I score real points with my interviewer for talking about this more than 5 minutes?
* If the answer is no, leave it out.



## Relevant Links
* Github
* Portfolio
* LinkedIn

Bonus (if they're good):
* Tumblr
* Twitter

## Technical
* List your past projects and the technologies you used.
* For each project, highlight one cool feature.
	* Even better: summarize a problem you encountered and solved.
* Look up how to spell and capitalize the technologies you mention.

## Work
Unless you worked as a web developer, this section is mainly to prove one thing:
I am a functional member of society.


Things to LEAVE OUT:

* Service jobs that paid the bills (waiter, grocery clerk, library assistant...).
* Jobs or internships having nothing to do with computers or the web.

Things to INCLUDE:

* Jobs where the web or some other computer technology was involved (eg. QA Tester).
   * Highlight a time when you taught yourself something technical on the job.
* Jobs where number-crunching was involved (analyst-type roles)

## Education
* Don't mention App Academy
* It's totally cool to leave out this section if you don't have a college degree.

## Personal
Only include this section if:
* You have a lot of whitespace.
* You have smart-person hobbies or talents (like chess).
