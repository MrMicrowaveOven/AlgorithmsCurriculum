- Prepare for Rejection

You won't hear back from most places you apply.
You will get rejected by a lot of people, usually because you "lack experience".
Alums with just as much or less experience than you are now working at TaskRabbit, Vimeo, and other super cool companies.
You just gotta keep trucking!

- First offer suck
The first companies to get back to you will be the smaller, more eager ones.
At the same time you keep getting better at interviews.
So when the first offers come in and they're in the lower range, don't let that affect your standards.
Keep trucking. The offers you get almost always improve over time.


- Shout it out loud!

Words of wisdom: don't be shy about the fact you're looking for a job.
Let the world know.
Post a Facebook/Twitter status, eg.
Put it in your Github profile, tell everyone you meet at meetups,
People like to help people.
You'll also get better at interviews just by talking to friends and strangers about what you're looking for.


- Job Search Advice from a Recruiter
I asked an in-house recruiter this morning what are the worst mistakes developers make when looking for jobs.

First thing she said: when she asks candidates what personal projects they've been working on, some answer "Nothing--I've been focusing on finding a job". She takes that as a bad sign. She wants to know you love coding so much you can't keep yourself away from a text editor.


- Inspiring alumnus story

 I spoke to an alumnus once who told me the inspiring story of his job search. He had exactly three weeks to find a job, otherwise he would be late on rent.  
	* Over the weekend after graduation he applied to 100 places.
	* Week 1 he had 12 pre-screenings.
	* Week 2 he had 8 in-person interviews.
	* Week 3 he had three offers.

He kept hearing back from companies he'd applied to after he was well into his new job. These places were very slow to get back to him, and he still wonders how things would have turned out had he had more than three weeks to get paid. So don't get discouraged if companies don't get back to you fast! They are more likely to be incompetent than you are to be unqualified.

This guy did not have a programming background or CS degree. He says he owes part of his success to his experience with job searches in the past. He acted professional at interviews, emailed interviewers after every round, etc. Let me know if you feel that's something that might be holding you back and we'll work on it.


- Pimp my Repo

Want to wow every employer who checks out your Github?
You'll notice a lot of the data structures & algorithms we cover are hard to find in Ruby on the web.
Contribute to sum of human knowledge with your own Ruby-implemeted data structures!
Here's a nice example
Imagine employers checking out your repo.
They see "Ruby Trie". They like things that are familiar so they go check that out.
Behold! You are a CS wiz who implements fancy data structures in cool languages just for fun! Hire this man/woman!
