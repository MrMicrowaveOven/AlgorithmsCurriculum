**Implement the Array#map function in JavaScript**

  ```js
    Array.prototype.myMap = function(block) {
        var i = 0;
        var final = [];
        while( i < this.length ) {
          final.push( block( this[i] ));
          i++;
        }
        return final;
    };
  ```
**In a SQL db, you have two tables, an employee table and a department table. Employees belong to only one department. Given a department name, find all the employees underneath it with a SQL query.**

  ```sql
    SELECT employees.* 
    FROM employees e 
    JOIN departments d
    ON e.department_id = d.id
    WHERE d.name = 'Accounting'
  ```
