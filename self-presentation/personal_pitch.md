# Prepare your Pitch

"So, tell me about yourself. What have you done in your career and what brought you here?"

Unnatural as it feels, this formality can score you a lot of points at an interview. Its main purpose is to spare your interviewer the burden of reading your résumé carefully. But since your answer will be longer than most things you say through the rest of the conversation, your interviewer is likely to sit back, listen to you talk, and ask him/herself "do I take this candidate seriously?".

If you're good at selling yourself, this is where you shine. Otherwise no worries. A 1 minute, well-rehearsed spiel is all you need to sound prepared and professional.


## Your 60-second life's story

 A sample outline for your inspiration:
* In college I chose to major in [...] // took a lot of classes in [...] because I like working on problems that involve [...]
* At [company] I accomplished [...] and [...] While I was at it I learned [...].
* I'd always had an affinity for computers so I taught myself HTML and JavaScript for fun.
* When I picked up Ruby, I immediately got hooked.
* I wanted to take it to the next level so I took some classes.
    * *Feel free to bring up App Academy if they ask for details. Also mention Ruby Monk.*
* Now I know I want to make this my career.

*Note: if you finished college more than 4 years ago, your life story starts with your first job after graduation (unless you did something really cool before).*



## Questions to expect

Have a 30-second answer ready for each of these. It looks very bad if you hesitate or stammer.

* Why do you want to be a programmer?
* What kinds of problems do you like to work on?
* What do you like about Ruby?


## Bonus

We've observed these quircky questions a lot. An quick and enthusiastic reponse will have an awesome effect.

*"Tell me about an interesting problem you solved."*
A lot of great options here. Your answer doesn't have to be from a personal project. For example using the Ruby object as a simple data structure to store association parameters when you were cloning [Active-Record][active-record-lite] was pretty sweet.

*What's your favorite data structure?*

*What's your favorite algorithm?*

*What's your favorite Ruby gem (other than Rails)?*
