# Cover Letter Examples

**One example letter**

Hi [Name or Team]:

I am a web developer with experience in Ruby, Rails, Javascript, and Backbone.

My most recent project is ABC.com, a book recommendation engine for Harry Potter fans. Through tagging, rating, commenting, filtering, and collective filtering features, the site helps people find additional works they might enjoy. 

I built my first website when I was 14, and have been involved in technology ever since. I worked for my first tech startup when I was 19, got a Bachelors of Science in Information Systems, worked as a technology consultant with Bechtel, and completed the coding bootcamp App Academy last moth.

**Another example letter** 


Dear { contact },

I’m a web developer with experience in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, and a background in molecular biology, looking for new opportunities to develop technological solutions for users. { companyBlurb }

My previous projects include XYZ (website.com), a photo-hosting website where photo albums and photos can be uploaded and tagged using the Cloudinary API and the Google Places API. The website uses jQuery UI to enable photo rearrangement, allowing users the ability to narrate their albums in a specific order. To improve the site’s responsiveness, HTML elements are automatically resized using a combination of Bootstrap and jQuery. 

Additional information on my background and projects are in the attached resume and can be viewed on my portfolio page (portfolio.com). Please let me know if you have any questions, and I look forward to hearing from you.

**And another**

Hello [ company ] Team

I'm a huge fan of company X because of Y and my experience with Z.  I think my background and skills would be a great fit for your company.

I am a web developer with a strong background in Ruby, Javascript, and frameworks such as Rails and Backbone. I honed my programming skills at the App Academy, a highly selective programming school that accepts less than 5% of applicants.  An example of my work can be viewed at www.project.com. The site is built on a Rails backend with Backbone serving as the responsive front end. It features the ability for users to create running teams.  Members can then easily create events for their teams.  Mapbox.js is utilized to allow users to produce beautiful maps of running routes that can be included in events so that the entire team can see the course.

In addition to my programming skills, I have gained invaluable experience as an US Army pilot, flying the KC-10 on critical missions around the world.  As an officer, I was entrusted with flying an $80M aircraft and leading a crew of up to 15 officers. Flexibility and the ability to react to rapidly changing situations were key skills necessary to successfully complete over 50 missions.

My past jobs and training have focused on quickly learning a vast array of new material and immediately applying it. I'm looking forward to contributing to an exciting and fast paced team at [company].
