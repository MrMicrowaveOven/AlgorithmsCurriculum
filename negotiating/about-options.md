# Employee Equity

## tl;dr

Treat your stock options like lottery tickets. Maybe someday they'll
be worth a lot, but you don't buy $5k worth of lottery tickets, do
you? Don't trade base salary for lottery tickets.

Why? Your company will probably eventually fail. Options vest over
four years and you shouldn't work that long at your first
company. Even if the company becomes valuable, it takes forever for it
to go IPO so you can sell shares. Your grant will be small and you'll
be diluted as the company takes on more investors.

Negotiate for salary, not for options. A high base salary means bigger
raises in the future. Future employers won't understand that you took
a low salary because you traded cash for a bunch of options. They'll
just look at the lower salary :-(

## Stock Options

This is a very abbreviated discussion of what stock options are.

Many companies offer stock options to their employees as part of their
compensation. An **option** is a right to purchase a share of the
company at a pre-arranged price (the **strike price**). The company
will set the strike price when it grants you the options; they are
obligated to set this based on the current **fair market value** (FMV)
of the company.

Because the strike price is set to the current FMV, options only
become valuable if the company appreciates in value. If the company is
worth $1/share when you join, you will be granted options with a
strike price of $1/share (the FMV). If the company does not appreciate
in value, you can **exercise** your options to pay the company
$1/share to buy a share worth $1. However, if the company has not
appreciated in value, this doesn't make you any money.

The hope (read: dream) is that the company will appreciate in value so
that it becomes worth, say, $2/share. Then, since you have been
granted the right to purchase a share at $1/share, you can exercise
the option to purchase shares worth $2 at a price of $1/share. This is
the good scenario.

The good news is that unexercised options don't lose you money. If the
company declines in value to $0.50/share, then it would be irrational
to exercise your options, because you would be paying $1 to buy
something worth $0.50. In this case, your options are worthless, but
at least you didn't put any of your own money in the game.

The key to options is to wait until they are worth more than the
strike price, and then buy. There is no benefit in exercising early
(well, there are tax reasons); just let your options vest and exercise
when they're worth something.

## Options vs Shares

Companies may offer you shares (they often call these **restricted
stock units**, or **RSU**) instead of stock options. The difference is
that options are a right to buy a share, whereas shares are just
shares.

If you ignore tax implications, receiving shares is better than
receiving options. This is because if you are granted shares, you
don't have to pay to buy the shares, which is what you have to do with
options.

Let's take an example. Say the FMV of a company is $1/share. If the
company grants you 1k shares, they have given you assets that have an
FMV of $1k. On the other hand, if the company grants you the right to
buy 1k shares at the FMV, then these are currently worth nothing: you
have the right to buy 1k shares at $1k, but they're only worth $1k.

If the company appreciates in value to $2/share, an option grant of 1k
shares becomes worth $1k, since you can buy 1k shares worth $2k at
$1k. On the other hand, if you received a grant of 1k shares, these
are now worth the full $2k. So again, shares are better than options.

Lastly, if the company declines in value to $0.50/share, your options
are worthless. Exercising them would mean you spend $1k for 1k shares
worth $500, so you would have lost $500. This is important:
disregarding tax reasons, you should not exercise options until they
are worth more than the strike price. In fact, ideally you won't
exercise the options until you can sell shares on the open market. The
whole point of options is to eliminate this downside risk. You can't
lose money on unexercised options.

On the other hand, if you were granted shares, your shares that you
paid nothing for are still worth $500.

## Why Do Companies Grant Options?

Companies grant options to motivate employees to grow the
company. They also do it because they only have granted you something
of value assuming the company grows. If the company grows, it's a
win-win for investors and employees. If the company shrinks, they gave
you nothing of value. In this sense, options are "cheaper" than cash.

Why not stock grants? There are a few reasons. First, you are not
required to pay any tax on the option when it vests. That's because
you were granted the right to purchase something worth $1 at the price
of $1. This is currently worthless, so the IRS does not treat this as
income.

If, on the other hand, you vest 1k shares worth $1k, you would have to
declare that as income and pay income tax. This can be especially
painful if the company is not public and you cannot sell the
shares. Imagine a scenario where you vest $1MM worth of shares, but
you have no cash. Then the IRS will send you a bill for X% of $1MM,
but you have no cash to pay them. You can't sell the stock, because
the company is not public yet. So you can't yet turn your stock into
cash, but the IRS wants to tax you anyway. Of course, the IRS only
accepts USD to pay taxes...

This happens to paper millionaires sometimes; they might mortgage
their house to pay the IRS.

Even worse, stock can decline in value. If you're granted shares (not
options) you have to pay income tax on stock that you can't sell. If
later the company fails (which happens all the time), you paid tax on
an asset that later turned out to be worthless. Dang. In the options
scenario, you would just let the options expire and owe no tax.

The other reasons benefit the company. By granting options, they are
ensuring you only make money if the company grows. In the case where
the company does not grow, they gave you something that wasn't worth
anything anyway. If they gave you shares, they'd be giving you
something of value even if the company shrinks.

## Vesting

Your stock options will **vest** over time. This means that you can't
immediately exercise your options and quit. The standard setup is that
25% of your options will vest after 1yr at the company; you lose all
your options if you leave before then. After that date, 1/48th of your
total options will vest each month. After a total of four years, your
options will be fully vested.

The company does this because it wants to use the options as an
incentive for you to remain over several years. This is a form of
golden handcuffs.

As your options vest, you may exercise them. You write a check to the
company and they give you a letter saying you own stock. Once you own
the stock, it's yours to keep even if you quit. However, you will lose
all your unvested options the day you quit the company. Also, any
vested but **unexercised** options are lost ~30days after you leave
the company.

Actually, you can even exercise before vesting (you can do this for
tax reasons), but the company will take back the shares if you quit
before they vest.

## Details, Valuing Options

To begin to evaluate an options offer, you need to know a few things:

* How many options are you being granted?
* What is the vesting schedule? (Probably 4yrs)
* How many outstanding shares are there? That is, what percentage of
  the company are you be granted the option to purchase?
* What is the FMV of a share? That is, what is the strike price?
  Alternatively, the most recent valuation of the company, divided by
  the number of outstanding shares should give you the FMV of a share.

It is typical that a company will tell you that they are granting you
options on X thousand shares, or to buy $X thousand dollars worth of
shares. For some reason they often don't tell you the share FMV or
numer of shares outstanding unless you ask. You do need that, because
without context, the number of options or FMV of the options is
useless...

NB: employee stock options needs to be approved by the board. The
offer letter you receive will say that your options require board
approval. This is a legal formality, totally normal, and the board
would never deny you your option grant. Do not be weirded out by
this. The board normally may meet only four times a year, so it will
take ~3mo.

### Calculating value

If you want to value an option grant, you need to:

1. Make up a future valuation of the company. For instance, maybe you
   think that the company will eventually be worth $100MM. **Note**:
   no one, not even the CEO, has any idea what this will be.
2. Subtract out the current FMV of the company. The difference is how
   much you think the company will appreciate. Say, for instance, that
   the company is currently valued at $10MM. You think the company
   will grow by $90MM. You have to do this because you buy shares at
   FMV.
3. Multiply by the size of your option grant, as a percentage of
   shares outstanding. This is how much of the appreciation in the
   company you have the right to buy. If your option grant is 0.1% of
   the shares outstanding, you are being granted the right to $90k of
   the appreciation.
4. Divide by the vesting period. This is how much of the appreciation
   you'll vest each year. With a four year vesting period, this is
   $22.5k/yr. Everyone forgets to do this.
5. **Multiply by zero**, because
    0. the company will never meet your
       wild-ass guess of its future value (99% of companies eventually
       fail and are worth nothing),
    0. you'll be diluted (your % ownership will drop) as the company
       takes on new investors/employees and issues more outstanding
       shares,
    0. the company takes forever to go public anyway. No matter
       how great the company does, you can't turn shares into money
       until IPO or purchase (a **liquidity event**). It's hard to
       sell your shares on something like Second Market because you'll
       have a very small block of shares, plus only the most
       fabulously successful companies will trade there.
    0. you'll quit before 4yrs to take a better, higher-paying job,
       leaving unvested shares on the table,
    0. [Taxman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqK97av7I3s),
    0. the company does something evil like fire you when your
       options become too valuable (cf., Skype, Zynga).

Take myself as an example. I vested 2k shares of Quantcast options
while I worked there (four years ago). I purchased them at a strike
price of $0.25. The latest round valued them at $1.09/share. That
means I made a grand total of ~$1,800 **over two years** from
options. Except that of course the company isn't public so actually my
shares are worth zero in real dollars that I can use to buy food and
toys for my cats. Quantcast is ~8yrs old and does >$100MM of revenue,
so this is actually the **good** case.

That's why it's important to multiply by zero.

## 83(b)

There are tax reasons why you might want to exercise early. I'm too
lazy to summarize these. Read about 83(b) elections if you want to
waste more time on this, or just enjoy tax laws. If so, you're
sick. You need help.
