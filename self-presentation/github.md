# Curating Your Github

## Delete and format
* Delete most of your repositories.
    * Delete your very early repos.
    * Delete your incomplete projects.
    * Delete all the mini Rails apps, except where you did something cool (eg. nesting comments in Reddit).
* Rename the repos you keep.
* Give them useful *readmes*.
    * Do this in your browser so that their last commit is not from 'App Academy Student'.
    * Keep some projects and name them explicitely.

## Nice Repos to Keep
* ActiveRecord Lite
* Rails Lite
* Asteroids
* Snake
* Tic-Tac-Toe & Tower of Hanoi
* Ruby recursion exercizes (if they're complete)
* BFS, DFS, Knight's Travails, 8 Queens, Word Chains

In the post-course curriculum you will learn about data structures and algorithms.
You will implement linked lists, binary trees, hashes, etc. in Ruby.
These implementations are actually rare in Ruby, so these are cool things to have.
Keep them in explicitely named repos, eg. "Ruby Linked List". Employers will <3.
