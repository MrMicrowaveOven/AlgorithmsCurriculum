# Pairboarding

Before you get started, read the [tips][tips] on solving whiteboard problems.

## Instructions

Everyday at 11am, pair with someone new. One of you takes question set A, the other takes question set B. For each of the question sets, one student has the problem and its solution. This is the interviewer. The interviewer makes the other student, the interviewee, solve the problem as for an interview. The interviewer cannot give out the actual answer, but should keep the interviewee on the right track with leading questions. The interviewee cannot ask for a hint or answer, but may ask insightful questions.

You may not refer to the web unless the question assumes technical knowledge that neither the interviewer nor the interviewee has (eg. a certain data structure). When the interviewee finds a solution, determine its time complexity and try to optimize.

Finally, switch the roles with a new question set.
