# W12D4
 * Continue pairboarding, applying, adding to Roadmap
  * Should be at 60 by EOD
* Graduation Day tonight!!
  * Don't forget to print out your resume!
  * Be proactive: don't give employers your resume and expect them to get in touch with you- ask for their contact info and you reach out to them!
  * If you see anyone with a nametag on just walking around or awkwardly standing, go up to them, introduce yourself, ask what company they're from and whether they're hiring, and if so, bring them to your station to talk. That might turn into a job! #jobhunter
* Tie up any loose ends before meeting with alumni and companies tonight
  * Resume, cover letter, LinkedIn, Github.
  * Capstone project, browser game, any other project listed on your resume
  * Your presentation, elevator speech, and personal pitch for use at the event
