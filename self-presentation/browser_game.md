# Javascript Project

The purpose of this project is twofold:

- Build something pretty, interactive and user-friendly to impress recruiters and other non-technical folks
- Demonstrate your mastery of vanilla Javascript and object-oriented design 

Historically, many App Academy folks have built classic arcade-style games -- Asteroids, Snake, [Pong](http://codymcnamara.github.io/pong/), [Breakout](http://nihilence.github.io/Breakawf/), [Tetris](http://erichsu.io/Fortris/) -- but these aren't the only choices.  You can make an educational game like [Exploding Numbers](http://www.cssherry.com/explodingnumbers/), a trivia game, a demonstration of some cool math thing like [Langton's Ant](http://scottduane.github.io/LangtonsAnt/), a maze solver, or a cool [demo of CSS skills](http://vveleva.com/css_demos/).  Here are some further resources to help you brainstorm:

- [FunInBrowser](http://www.funinbrowser.com/) -- a site with a lot of simple-ish browser games.  Use these to get some ideas!
- [Shodor](http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/activities/) -- an ugly but complete site of math concepts that might make good JS projects.  The stuff under the Discrete tab is especially good.
- This resource on different kinds of [algorithm visualization](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/)

You want to choose a JS project that's reasonable to complete with about 2 days of work, but also stands out as unique.  This can be a hard balance to strike, so think carefully about your choice.  Your project should be at should be at least as impressive (technically) as Asteroids or Snake (something like TicTacToe or Towers of Hanoi is not complex enough), but we advise you **not** to choose Snake or Asteroids.  Employers see these two games too often from bootcamp grads and sometimes even use them as a means of screening out candidates in the early stages of the application process.

Additionally, you should **not** use online tutorials or the Phaser.js library to create your game.  Tutorials often give you a lot of code snippets -- at best, it looks like you don't actually know how to write it yourself, and at worst, it looks like you plagiarized someone else's work.  Phaser is a useful library for creating games, but that's the only thing it's used for.  No employer is looking for a candidate that knows how to write in Phaser, so it's a waste of your time in terms of job-seeking to learn it.  It is okay to use others' Github repos as guides -- but they should only be guides.  **Do not copy code from another person's repo.**

In summary, here are the checklists of what your game should have:

### Live Project

* Landing page/modal with obvious, clear instructions 
* Interactivity of some kind 
* A really nice, polished frontend 
* If it has music, the option to mute or stop it
* Hosted from your portfolio site on GitHub pages

### Repo

* README
  * Link to live version
  * Instructions on how to play/use the project
  * List of techs/languages/plugins/APIs used
  * Technical implementation details for anything worth mentioning
    * Basically anything you had to stop and think about before building
    * Code snippets for these (make sure it looks good)
  * To-dos/future features
* No .DS_Stores
* Organize into /assets and /lib
