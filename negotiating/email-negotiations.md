# Negotiation Emails

## After getting an offer

As soon as you get an offer:

1. Tell your career coach
2. Get as much as you can to make a decision.
3. Follow up with your other leads.
  * "I have an offer elsewhere"
  * "I really like what your company does"
  * "I'd love to go through your application process so that you I can include you in my final decision."

These are the companies you should contact:

* Companies you've interviewed with and are waiting to hear back from.
  * If you haven't written your standard thank-you-for-the-interview
  email, consolidate the two messages in the same email.
* Companies where you've scheduled a phone call or interview that falls
outside your deadline to make a decision on the existing offer.
* Companies that you haven't heard back from at all that seemed cool.

Here's a sample email for your inspiration.

> Hi {COMPANY CONTACT/COMPANY NAME},
>
> I applied to join your team last week. I wanted to let you know I've
> received another offer {from COMPANY NAME (if it's a good one)}. I
> have until {DATE} to get back to them. While it's an interesting offer,
> I admire what {COMPANY NAME} does and would love to see your application
> process through before making a final decision. I hope to hear back from
> your team soon.
>
> All the best,
>
> {YOUR NAME}

## If they are in a hurry

Many companies will want you to decide in less than a week. Resist this.
You're looking to make a long-term commitment and it's in no-one's
interest to rush your decision. If they insist, that's because they
want to lock you down before you get competing offers. This puts you in
a strong position to ask them for a higher offer. Here's a stock email
you take can inspiration from.

> My only concern is that I only started my job search a few weeks ago
> and am still in talks with several other companies. I have to consider
> the opportunity cost of taking myself off the job market before
> waiting to hear back from them. Could [company name] raise the base on
> the initial offer? Given a package with higher compensation, I would
> be in a better position to cut those conversations short and start on
> [the date] as you request. Let me know.

## If they give you a verbal offer 

 If a verbal offer is made, a response could be, “I’m very excited about the opportunity to work for you and this organization. Since this is such a significant decision for both of us, I’d be more comfortable if the offer was formalized in writing and I could look it over.”  
 
 (If you already missed your chance to do this, you can consider writing a followup email where you reiterate the details of the verbal offer.  This isn't as good as an offer letter, but puts at least some details in writing in the meantime.)


## If the offer is low

Do not fret over asking for more. Companies do not have feelings. They
are however a lot more likely to invest in you and train you well if
they're paying a fair market rate.

These are real emails written by students. The outcome was successful in
both cases.

**Example 1**: with no competing offers.

> Thank you for extending me the offer of employment as a [job title] at
> [company name]. I really enjoyed getting to meet with [interviewer
> name], [interviewer name], and [interviewer name] on Monday and think
> the team is definitely the right cultural fit for me. Your company
> does some seriously interesting work and I think it's a great
> opportunity to learn skills that I won't find elsewhere.
>
> In light of my skills, however, I am concerned about the salary you
> offered. App Academy is a rigorous program with a 5% acceptance rate
> and a 10% attrition rate. This year App Academy graduates have been
> finding an average starting salary of [average in city]. Given my
> track record of being a top performer, I see my market value as
> [$5-10k above average]. If you can put together that offer, I will
> sign immediately and cancel all other interviews.
>
> Again, I am really looking forward to joining your team and can't wait
> to start on 9/23/2013 as you requested. But in order to do that, I
> need you to make me a more competitive offer.

**Example 2**: no competing offers

> Thank you for sending that offer letter over! I really enjoyed getting to meet the whole [company] team and I think the 
> company is a great cultural fit for me. On top of that, I think [company] is creating a really awesome product and I 
> would have the opportunity to pick up skills that I won't find at other companies.
> 
> After reviewing the offer letter in more detail, I do have a few questions/concerns. First, I'm very excited about the 
> generous insurance that [company] offers to employees, and I was wondering whether or not that coverage also extends to 
> an employee's spouse. 
> 
> I am very eager to join the team at [company], however I do have a small concern with the salary. Given that the average
> salary for a software engineer in [city] is 125k (link), and though I am just starting out, I see my market value
> as being 115k. I have always performed above average in the past, as indicated by my strong GPA at [university]. I am 
> confident that I will continue to maintain a high performance level at [company] and  contribute maximally to the
> company. If you were able to offer a salary of 115k, I would cancel all other interviews and sign immediately 
> (tonight), without waiting to hear back from other companies.
> 
> Again, I am really excited about the opportunity to work with [company], and would love to start on [date], as
> requested. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon!


**Example 3**: with competing offers.

> Thanks for sending this over! I think [company name] is a great
> company, and that I'd be a good fit. My one apprehension right now is
> the compensation. [Lowball figure] is on the low side of the offers I
> am considering, as well as what I am hearing from my App Academy
> peers. The average is closer to [average in city]. This Indeed search
> shows a [number] average for a [job title] in [city] [links to
> Indeed search]. If you were able to raise the offer, I would feel much
> more comfortable accepting it.
>
> I know we discussed that one of my favorite things about [company
> name] was that [employee], [employee], and [employee] had all been
> there for over three years. That kind of longevity is amazing, and
> exactly what I'm looking for. This is my first big leap as a
> developer, so I'm looking for a longterm, 2+ year position where I can
> grow. I know [company name] provides that environment, and I know I
> would be a valuable asset to the [company] team. I look forward to
> hearing from you!

**Template**: a basic format for the emails is:
* Thanks so much for the offer
* I'm excited about your company for [specific reason]
* I have one minor concern about compensation
* My requested compensation (use a specific number that's higher than your goal so there's room to negotiate)
* Reason I feel I should be compensated
  * There are lots of reasons you might be a great fit for the company. Consider two things:   
    * Anything the company has mentioned that makes you a unique fit.  For example:
       * Culture is paramount to them and you fit in perfetly
       * They want someone with a finance background, which you have
       * Your take-home-project showed that you're a great UI designer and they need UI help
    * Anything that makes you a strong applicant or employee.  Some examples:
       * You attended a top school or had a high GPA
       * You were very successful in your previous jobs
       * You bring experience in management/tech/startups 
    * If you have other offers, then that's your strongest point
       * If your other offer is higher or is at a top company, say so
       * If not, say that you have another offer but would be certain about choosing their company if they increase the salary
* (If the offer is lower than average) Comparison to the a/A average or to developer salaries in [city]
* If these requests are met, I would be delighted to join
