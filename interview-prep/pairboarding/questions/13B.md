**How would you write a program to solve Sudoku? (high level description)**

1. Loop through all the empty cells, and for each cell generate a list of possible values. If a cell has only one possible value, fill it in.
2. Starting from the cells that have the shortest list of possible values, try the value, and recurse to see if the puzzle can be solved.


**(Word Chains) Given a source word, target word and an English dictionary, transform the source word to target by changing/adding/removing 1 character at a time, while all intermediate words being valid English words. Return the transformation chain which has the smallest number of intermediate words.**
