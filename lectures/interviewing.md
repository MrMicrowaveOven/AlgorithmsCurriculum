Best ways to get good at it, in order:

* Do a lot of interviews,
* Practice, with a life-like setting,
* Think about how you can do better.

This workshop does the latter.

## General Tips

0. Talk
  * If you're stuck on something, explain what you're stuck on.
  * Explain each step, ideally before you start it so your interviewer
    can offer tips if he/she feels like it.
  * Don't allow long silences. If you have to, explain what you're about
    to ponder.
  * (To sympathize with your interviewer, think of your reaction when
    your computer takes a minute to process something without showing a
progress bar.)
0. Be a little anal
  * Don't stop until they tell you to. If you get to
  a solution
     0. optimize the time and space efficiency,
     0. improve the code style, make it more concise.
  * Write things down: you don't lose points for doing calculations on
    the board, even if it's "easy math". No one will fault you for being
clear.
  * Start with a roadmap so you don't miss an exit.
0. Engage
  * Smile, take interest in the problem.
  * Write from the top left of the board.
  * Say "we".
  * Prefer whiteboard over paper so that you and the interviewer
   are facing the same direction.

## First Steps

* Reformulate the problem to
  0. make sure you understand the problem,
  0. internalize the problem,
  0. start thinking about how to abstract it.
* Ask clarifying questions about the input. For example, if the function takes an array of numbers. Are they just any numbers? Peopleâ€™s ages, ie. integers between 0 and 130? Temperatures, ie. floats between -459.67 10**32?
* Process two or three easy cases on board to build an intuition.
* Build and explain your roadmap.

## Break down and simplify

Break down: "The core of the solution will be one function that does this,
another that does that, and a third that does something else."

Simplify: "Let's assume for now that the cow is spherical."

## Own the problem

* Use the top right of the board for notes.
  * to manage your roadmap,
  * to keep track of future optimizations you might make,
  * to note problems you anticipate that aren't immediately relevant.
* Postpone the trivial parts.
  * It's ok to assume that you have a helper method as long as you
    promise to get back to it later.
* Manage the scope.
  * Start with a dumbed-down version of the problem (ie. simplify).
  * If the problem has ambiguous scope, pick the easiest version and
    tell the interviewer you'll generalize your solution to show you're
aware of the trickier scope.
* Offer your opinion on tradeoffs.
   * Noticing that there are several possibilities is good. Asking the
     interviewer which they favor is ok.
   * Offering your own take on it is even better.

## Takeaways

**Before Starting: Be Communicative**

0. Restate the problem
0. Run the function on small inputs
0. State assumptions about the input that make the problem simpler
0. Break down the problem into its functions
0. Replace the problem with a simpler, related one if necessary
0. Write a roadmap in the top right corner

**During: Manage the Scope**

0. Pick the easiest version of the problem and make that clear
0. Simplify the problem
0. Leave the straightforward parts for later


**Before Stopping: Show Thoroughness**

0. Ask if you should write out helper functions
0. Refactor
0. Analyze Time and Space performance
0. Talk about other improvements and tradeoffs
