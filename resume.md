# Preparing your Resume
* Your résumé is your best shot at proving you're not a yahoo.
* What's on there makes a big difference.
* What's not on there, and how you lay everything out, makes an equally big difference.


# Layout
* ONE PAGE ONLY
* Lots and lots of whitespace


# Content
* Have a high bar for what goes on your résumé:
	* Ask yourself: would I score points for talking about this more than 5 minutes during an interview?
	* If the answer is no, leave it out.


## Technical
* List your past projects (may include asteroids and snake) and the technologies you used.
* For each project, highlight one cool feature.
	* Even better: summarize a problem you encountered and solved.
* Look up how to spell and capitalize the technologies you mention.

## Work
Unless you worked as a web developer, this section mainly proves one thing:
you are a functional member of society.

Bonus points:
* If you worked with the web, eg. as a QA tester.
* If you did something very quantitative, eg. as a financial analyst.

Things you must LEAVE OUT:
	* Service jobs that paid the bills (waiter, grocery clerk, library assistant...).
	* Jobs or internships having little to do with the web.
Things you should  INCLUDE:
	* Jobs where the web was involved.
		* Where appropriate, highlight that you made yourself more technical to above and beyond the call of duty.
	* Jobs where number-crunching was involved.

## Education
* Don't mention App Academy
* It's totally cool to leave out this section if you don't have a college degree.

## Personal
Only include this section if:
	* You have a lot of whitespace.
	* You have smart-person hobbies (eg. chess).
	* You have athletic-person hobbies (eg. triathlons).
