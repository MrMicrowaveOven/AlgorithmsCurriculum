## `myMap`

Implement the `Array#map` function in JavaScript.

```js
Array.prototype.myMap = function(fn) {
  var final = [];
  this.forEach(function (el) {
    final.push(fn(el));
  });

  return final;
};
```

## Employees Query

In a SQL db, you have two tables, an employees table and a departments
table. Employees belong to only one department. Write a SQL query that,
given a department name, finds all the employees in that department.

```sql
SELECT
  employees.*
FROM
  employees e
JOIN
  departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
WHERE
  d.name = ?
```
