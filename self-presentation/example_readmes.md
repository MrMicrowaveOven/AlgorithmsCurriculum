#Writing ReadMe's

**Every project on your resume needs a great ReadMe.**

ReadMe breakdown:
* Link to live site
* A couple sentences to describe what it is
* Instructions/how to play (for games)
* How to run the code (for Ruby projects)
* List of techs/languages/plugins/APIs used
* Technical implementation details for anything worth mentioning
* Basically anything you had to stop and think about before building
* Snippets or links to see code for these (make sure it looks good)
* Screenshots of anything related that looks cool 
* To-dos/future features
* No .DS_Stores
* Organize into /assets and /lib
