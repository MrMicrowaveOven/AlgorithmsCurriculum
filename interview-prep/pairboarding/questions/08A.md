**You have 100 numbers whose range is from 1-99 and there is exactly one repeat. How do you find the repeat? What's the time complexity?**

Take the summation for a series of natural numbers covering 1-99, then sum all the numbers you were given. The difference is the missing number. That's linear time.


**Implement a stack with a 'bonus' method that returns the maximum value of the stack. The `max` method should take O(1) time.**

Each node in the stack maintains a reference to the largest node in the stack at the time it was pushed in. To determine the largest node, we only need to look at the head of the stack.

  ```ruby
    class Node
      attr_reader :value
      attr_accessor :max, next
    
      def initialize(value)
        @value = value
        @next, @max = nil
      end
    end
    
    class MaxStack
      def initialize
        @head = nil
      end
    
      def push(value)
        n = Node.new(value)
    
        if @head && n.max < @head.max
          n.max = @head.max
        else
          n.max = n
        end
    
        n.next = @head
        @head = n
      end
    
      def pop
        n = @head
        @head = @head.next
    
        n.value
      end
    
      def max
        @head.max.value
      end
    end
  ```
