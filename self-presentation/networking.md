Hi {CONTACT NAME},  

My name is {YOUR NAME}, and I am a web developer specializing in Ruby and JavaScript.   

Recently, I've become very interested in {COMPANY FIELD} and {INDUSTRY DETAILS},

I am currently looking to apply for the {SPECIFIC ROLE}.

Please let me know what might work for you.  

Thanks!
