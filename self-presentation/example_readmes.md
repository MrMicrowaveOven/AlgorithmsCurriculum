#Writing ReadMe's

**For help writing github Readme's for projects, see examples below.**

ReadMe breakdown:
* Live Link
* A couple sentences to describe what it is
* Show off cool features via descriptions, code snippets, etc.  

For a project that is not on the web, be especially sure to have a ReadMe.  
* Include how to run the code (they are unlikely to do this, but they should still know how)
* Screenshots of anything related that looks cool
