# Ongoing Pairboarding Practice Group

Open to all graduates of App Academy, this weekly meetup is intended to give job seekers the chance to keep their whiteboarding skills sharp. It is highly recommend that all job seekers attend, especially those who haven't recently been through the pairboarding curriculum.

We meet at **1:30 pm** on **Thursdays** at App Academy's office:

160 Spear Street, 14th Floor  
San Francisco

The structure of each meeting will be a brief check-in circle to talk about the job search, seek advice, and share triumphs. Participants will then be split into pairs to solve algorithms problems. **Students are encouraged to bring problems if they have them.**

To express interest in the group and receive updates and reminders, please [join the associated Google Group][aa-group]. If the meeting is cancelled for a particular day, it will be announced through this Google Group.
