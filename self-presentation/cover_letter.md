# Foreword

**Don't Advertise App Academy**

Few companies realize how selective App Academy is and what an accomplishment it is to complete the course. Meanwhile employers don't like to feel flooded by candidates with the same profile. There is also a lingering suspicion among old school engineers that a graduate from a programming course is not "one of them".

You don't gain much by telling companies you were at App Academy. We strongly recommend you leave it out of your application materials (cover letter, portfolio, LinkedIn...). At interviews you might be asked where you learned to code. At that point you can bring up App Academy as one of several resources that you used. Until then don't volunteer the information. This way fewer companies will nix you before giving you fair consideration.

**Don't Call Yourself 'Full Stack'**

App Academy trained you in the full stack, but calling yourself a 'full stack engineer' is a little premature. 'Full stack' often means "so experienced I can build whatever you throw at me". For now just call yourself a web developer. Make it clear you are very strong in both Rails and JavaScript.


# Cover Letter

Do not sweat the cover letter. Some HR people (very few) take off points if you don't have one attached to your application. Most HR people do not read your cover letter because they all say the same thing anyway. The point is just to have one.

Do not try to make an impression with fancy words and formalities. Antipattern: "Hence I believe I am uniquely positioned to thrive in the challenging environment your company provides."

There are subtler ways to make your cover letter stand out. The good news is they also scale well for sending out many job applications.

Build a template with these classy touches:

* Have a minimally styled header that includes your contact information.
* Below that insert the date.
* Below that insert the name / title / company name / work address of the person you're writing to.

Here's an [example][example-cover-letter] of some cool templating. Note that this letter is about two times longer than yours needs to be and the language is way too flowery. Use a neutral sign off like "Best Regards" or "All the Best".

# Sample Cover Letter

**Use this as an inspiration. Do not copy it word for word.**

The language is intentionally casual. Make it more formal if the company seems less laid back (especially if they're based in New York).

    Hi Joe,

    I'm writing to apply to the Rails Engineer opening at CoolCo. I am a web developer with experience in Rails and JavaScript.
    
    I'm currently looking for opportunities to join a team that's building an awesome product
    and solving hard problems. CoolCo's online cat rental agency sounds like a great combination of the two.
    I would love to connect to talk more about your product and the engineering profile you're looking for.

    My résumé is attached for your convenience. You can also see my sample projects here: www.markzuckerberg.com,
    and read some of the code I've written here: www.github.com/markzuckerberg.
    I look forward to being in touch.
    
    Best,
    
    Mark Zuckerberg


 Addressing the letter when you don't know the name of the person reading it:
* Use *"Hello [company] team"* if they're a laidback company.
* Use *"Dear Sir or Madam"* if they seem stiff.

# Emailing like a boss

**Etiquette**

Some companies don't provide exact instructions on how to apply. If that's the case and you're applying via email, include your cover letter and résumé as attachments and also paste your cover letter in the body of the email.

The subject line is just to find your email in an crowded inbox. "Junior Rails Engineer - San Francisco" is more helpful than "Applying to CoolCompany, inc".

**Signatures**

Set up a signature with your mail client. Include the link to your portfolio site.

You could try something like this:

    Best,
    
    Mark Zuckerberg
    markzuckerberg.com
