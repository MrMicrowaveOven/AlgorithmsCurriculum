## Personal Pitch
* Practice your [personal pitch][personal-pitch] every day with your pairboarding partner and give each other feedback.

## Jobberwocky
* All materials should be submitted by lunch so you're ready to apply tomorrow.
* Continue to add 10 `will apply` companies.

## Algorithm Practice
* See the algorithms reading [here][algorithms-curriculum].
* If you finish the a/A pairboarding problems early,
    * Stay sharp using [these tests][algo-specs] only after you get
      through the pairboarding.
    * Try [Codility][codility] if you want to do more on your own.
