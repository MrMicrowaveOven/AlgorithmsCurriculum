## Non-Comparison Sorts

Part 1: Say that I gave you an array of length `n`, containing the
numbers `1..n` in jumbled order. "Sort" this array in `O(n)` time. You
should be able to do this without looking at the input.

Part 2: Say that I give you an array of length `n` with numbers in the
range `1..N` (`N >= n`). Sort this array in `O(n + N)` time. You may
use `O(N)` memory.

Part 3: Say I give you an array of `n` strings, each of length `k`. I
claim that, using merge sort, you can sort this in `O(knlog(n))`,
since comparing a pair of strings takes `O(k)` time.

I want you to beat that. Sort the strings in `O(kn)`. **Hint**: do not
compare any two strings. You may assume all strings contain only
lowercase letters `a..z` without whitespace or punctuation.

```ruby
def sort1(arr)
  (1..(arr.length)).to_a
end

def sort2(arr, max_val)
  counts = Array.new(max_val + 1, 0)
  arr.each { |el| counts[el] += 1 }

  arr = []
  counts.each_index do |val|
    counts[val].times { arr << val }
  end
  arr
end

def sort3(strings, length)
  (length - 1).downto(0) do |i|
    buckets = Array.new(26) { [] }
    strings.each do |string|
      letter = string[i]
      buckets[letter.ord - "a".ord] << string
    end

    strings = []
    buckets.each do |bucket|
      bucket.each { |string| strings << string }
    end
  end

  strings
end
```

## `weighted_random_index`

Given an array, write a function that will return a random index of
the array. The probability of an index being returned is weighted by
the value at that index against the sum of the array values. For
example, for the array `[4, 6, 8]`, index 0 should be returned with 4
in 18 odds, index 1 should be returned with 6 in 18 odds, and index 2
should be return with 8 in 18 odds. Implement this in `O(n)` time.

```ruby
def weighted_random_index(arr)
  total_sum = arr.inject(:+)
  value = rand(total_sum)

  cumulative_sum = 0
  arr.each_with_index do |el, i|
    cumulative_sum += el
    return i if value < cumulative_sum
  end
end
```
