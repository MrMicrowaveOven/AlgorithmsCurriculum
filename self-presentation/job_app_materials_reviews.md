# Job App Materials Reviews

The point of this is to get your job application materials as perfefct as possible. You will probably miss a thing or two, so we'll rely on an extra set of eyes to catch those mistakes.

## Instructions

You'll be assigned two people every day from W10D2..W11D2 (through W10D5 in SF) and you'll review all of their job application materials. That includes their resume, cover letter, browser game, capstone project, code_intensive, and portfolio site. Make sure to go through the checklists for each:

* [Resume](./resume.md)
* [Cover Letter](./cover_letter.md)
* [Browser Game](./browser_game.md)
* [Capstone Project](https://github.com/appacademy/capstone-project-curriculum/blob/master/readings/capstone-checklist.md)
* [Code Instensive](./code_intensive.md)
* [Portfolio](./porfolio.md)

To get the links for everything you need to review, just ask the person you're reviewing to email them to you. You'll need Google Doc URLs for the Resume and Cover Letter, and GitHub and Live URLs for all the other materials. 

### Resume and Cover Letter

Review the resume and cover letter on the Google Doc itself by adding comments 
to the parts they should change (select some text and then command+option+m). 
For this, the person you're reviewing will have to give you permission first. 
Ask them to give you "can comment" permission by clicking on the "Share" button 
on the top right of the Doc.

### Other Materials

Respond to the email your reviewee sent you with the links to their materials with all of the comments you have for each project. Separate them out by project and by github/live. For example:

* Portfolio
  * GitHub
    * Remove .DS_Stores
    * Add live link to README
  * Live
    * Have link to download resume in top navbar
    * Add GitHub links for each project repo
* Asteroids
  * GitHub
    * ...
  * Live
    * ...

### Next Steps

The same way you'll be reviewing 2 people, 2 other people will be reviewing 
your stuff. Take those comments that they give you and perfect your materials
before the next day so the next reviewer can review the new version. In the
beginning, there will probably be a lot of comments for you to address. Take 
one project at a time so you don't get overwhelmed, and ask others around you
for help if you get stuck on something- whether it's wording/phrasing or code, 
it's amazing what a second set of eyes will help you uncover.
