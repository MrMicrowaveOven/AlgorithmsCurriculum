## `max_unique_psub`

This is a hard one! Enjoy the challenge!

Let's define a **pseudo-substring**: `psub` is a pseudo-substring of
`str` if there exists some `[i_0, i_1, ..., i_n]` such that:

* `i_0, ..., i_n` is an **increasing sequence**; `i_l < i_m` for `l < m`.
* `psub[l] == str[i_l]`

For example:

```
"abc" is a psub of "abcdef"
"ace" is a psub of "abcdef"
"cdf" is a psub of "abcdef"

"fed" is _not_ a psub of "abcdef" (letters are out of order)

psubs("abcd") == [
  "a",
  "ab",
  "abc",
  "abcd",
  "ac",
  "acd",
  "ad",
  "b",
  "bc",
  "bcd",
  "bd",
  "c",
  "cd",
  "d"
]
```

Next, recall the definition of **lexicographical order**:

* `str1 > str2` IF
* (a) `str1 != str2` AND EITHER
* (b1) `str2` is a prefix of `str1` OR
* (b2) at the first position at which `str1` and `str2` differ (say `i`),
  `str1[i] > str2[i]`.

For instance: `"abc" > "ab"` and `"acb" > "abc"`.

**Given a string `str`, find the lexicographical greatest psubstring.** Solve it
first by generating all psubstrings and picking the greatest (in Big-Oh, how
many are there?). Recurison? Next, improve your algorithm to do this in
`O(nlog(n))` time.

## Solution

```ruby
# O(nlog(n))
def max_unique_psub(str)
  # sort larger letters first, breaking ties by using leftmost letters
  # first.
  letter_positions = str
    .split("")
    .each_with_index
    .sort_by { |letter, pos| [-letter.ord, pos] }

  psub = ""
  cur_position = -1
  letter_positions.each do |letter, pos|
    # psub must be appear in `str` left-to-right
    next if pos < cur_position

    psub << letter
    cur_position = pos
  end

  psub
end
```
