# Ongoing Pairboarding Practice Group

Open to all graduates of App Academy, the twice-weekly pairboarding group is intended to give job seekers the chance to keep their whiteboarding skills sharp.

We meet at **3:00 pm** on **Tuesdays** and **Thursdays** at App Academy's new office:  
160 Spear Street, 14th Floor  
San Francisco

Our first meeting will be on **February 2nd, 2016**.

The structure of each meeting will be a brief check-in circle, to talk about the job search, seek advice, and share triumphs. Participants will then be split into pairs to solve algorithm problems. **Students are encouraged to bring problems if they have them.**

To express interest in the group and receive updates and reminders, please join the associated Google Group. If the group is cancelled on a particular day, it will be announced through this Google Group.
