## `fast_intersection`

Given `arr1` and `arr2`, find the intersection of both sets. It should
be trivial to write an `O(n**2)` solution. Use sorting to solve in
`O(nlog(n))`. Next, improve this to `O(n)` time (maybe use a non-array
datastructure).

```ruby
def intersection1(arr1, arr2)
  arr1.uniq.select { |el| arr2.include?(el) }
end

def intersection2(arr1, arr2)
  arr1, arr2, idx1, idx2 = arr1.sort, arr2.sort, 0, 0

  intersection = []
  while idx1 < arr1.length && idx2 < arr2.length
    case arr1[idx1] <=> arr2[idx2]
    when -1
      idx1 += 1
    when 0
      intersection << arr1[idx1]
      idx1 += 1
      idx2 += 1
    when 1
      idx2 += 1
    end
  end
  intersection
end


def intersection3(arr1, arr2)
  seen = Hash.new(0)
  intersection = []
  arr1.each { |el| seen[el] += 1 }
  
  arr2.each do |el| 
    intersection << el if seen[el] > 0
    seen[el] -= 1
  end
  
  intersection
end
```

## `common_subsets`

Write a function that takes two arrays (`arr1` and `arr2`) of integers
and returns an array with all the subsets commmon to both.

Don't generate all subsets of `arr1` and `arr2`, which would take time
exponential in the size of `arr1`/`arr2` (and take `O(2**n)` memory as
well). Instead, directly generate the subsets of both.

```ruby
def common_subsets(arr1, arr2)
  subsets(intersection3(arr1, arr2))
end

def subsets(arr)
  return [[]] if arr.empty?

  val = arr[0]
  subs = subsets(arr.drop(1))
  new_subs = subs.map { |sub| sub + [val] }

  subs + new_subs
end
```

## `can_win`

Given an array and index, find if it's possible to reach 0 by starting
at the index and repeatedly moving left/right by the distance found at
`array[index]`.

Hint: Use memoization to record where you've been.

```ruby
# A non-recursive solution.
def can_win(array, index)
  positions_to_try = [index]
  visited_positions = Array.new(array.length, false)
  visited_positions[index] = true

  until positions_to_try.empty?
    # TA: We should probably use a queue for this.
    position = positions_to_try.shift
    value = array[position]

    if value == 0
      return true
    end

    [position + value, position - value].each do |pos|
      next if visited_positions[pos]
      next if (pos < 0 || array.length <= pos)

      positions_to_try << pos
      # This insures we don't add a position twice to our queue.
      visited_positions[pos] = true
    end
  end

  false
end
```
