Items in brackets are ones that are good to know about although you can't implement them for your own projects.

## Ways to Improve Performance

**DB layer**

* Index lookup columns (see lol_dba and rack-mini-profiler)
* Order indices to start from the most selective columns
* Denormalize the schema (only worth it for huge performance gains)
* [Use NoSQL for non-crucial data.]

**Application layer**

* Cache DB queries (see Russian Doll Caching)
* Use ActiveRecord counter cache
* Use a faster server (see Thin)
* Trade more space for less time in your code
* Cache rendered views
* Avoid N+1 queries
* Paginate long results
* Use background jobs (e.g. for email)
* Use Adequate Record (Rails 4.2 only) to add extra caching
* Favor Model#pluck to avoid the overhead of creating Active Record models when you can avoid it
* In views, order records by primary key instead of created_at (it’s faster and almost equivalent)
* [Use a multithreaded server (see Puma)]
* [Add RAM to your server]
* [Upgrade Ruby version if you’re using an old one]
* [Flush the buffer right after </head>]
* [Use several servers and a load-balancer]

**Network**

*Server-side*

* Load third-party assets through a CDN
* [Use a reverse proxy server like Varnish]
* Limit number of different hostnames but split components across hostnames
* Prefer GET to POST requests where it makes sense
* Minimize cookie sizes
* Preload components
* Replace redirects with Alias and mod_rewrite
* Use servers that are close to your users
* Uptime Robot (Heroku-specific)

*Client-side*

* Keep components under 25k for iPhones so they can be cached
* Enable asset caching with ETags, or remove ETags altogether
* Configure cache-control Headers
* Weed out predictable 404s from unavailable assets
* Minify assets
* Concatenate assets
* Use CSS Sprites
* Gzip components (see Rack::Deflater)

**Frontend**

*Assets*

* Avoid CSS-embedded Javascript
* Avoid redundant CSS rules
* Don’t use inline CSS or JS if those assets are big enough to be cached
* Tag scripts as async if you don’t care what order they’re executed in or if they’re from 3rd parties
* Don’t use @import for CSS
* Limit third-party JS libraries to what you need (e.g. jQuery.ui.sortable.js vs. jQuery.ui.all.js)

*Markup*

* Put stylesheets at the top
* Put scripts at the bottom (unless one does some writing to the body)
* Limit the number of DOM elements (see document.getElementsByTagName(‘*’).length)

*Images*

* Inline images
* Limit image sizes to just the size and resolution needed on the page

*Javascript*

* Limit script interactions with the DOM
* Replace JS logic with CSS transforms
* Use vanilla JS for standardized DOM manipulations
* Load more async data after main page is loaded
* Cache array lengths inside for loops
* Don’t modify class attributes on the fly

*User Perception*

* Use loading animations
* Use progressive JPEGs
