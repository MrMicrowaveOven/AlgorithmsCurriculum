# W11D4
* Continue mock interviewing and adding companies to Jobberwocky.
* Attend the Algorithms lecture at 4:30.  

## Negotiations
* Read about [negotiating an offer][offer-negotiation].
* Get some data points for [salary negotiations][salary-data].
* You can also check out this [HackerNewsarticle][hn-negotiation-article]
* Attend the negotiations lecture after lunch

## START APPLYING!!
  * **From now on until you get a job, apply to 10 companies from your companies list every weekday**.  
    * This will take 3-7hours/day.
    * Apply only to 3s for your first 80 applications. Then start with 2s and 1s.
  * **Add every application into the Jobberwocky**. Update whether you've done a pre-onsite, interviewed, got rejected, or got an offer.
    * pre-onsite: a phone screen or take-home problem or both
    * interviewed: refers to an on-site, in-person interview
  * **You will be on roll call until you submit 200 applications.** It's prohibitively difficult for us to support students who are struggling with the job search if they stop coming in.  Students that have sent 200 applications are also encouraged to come in.  Students that job hunt from the office get more help and find jobs faster.
