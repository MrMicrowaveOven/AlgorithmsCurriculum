(Assume you are applying to Slack) 

## Five Year Plan

Where do you see yourself in five years?

**NB**: show that you have thoughtful, reasonable goals in mind.

## `subsets`

Write a function that takes an array and returns all of its
subsets. How many sets will it return?

```ruby
def subsets(arr)
  return [[]] if arr.empty?

  val = arr[0]
  subs = subsets(arr.drop(1))
  new_subs = subs.map { |sub| sub + [val] }

  subs + new_subs
end
```

## `longest_palindrome`

Write a function that will take a string and return the indices of the
start/end of the longest palindrome it contains.

Your palindrome checker could reverse the string and compare it to the
original, but that takes extra memory (that takes `O(n)` extra
memory). Instead, you should be able to solve this problem with `O(1)`
memory.

The naive solution is to generate all of the substrings (of which there are
`O(n**2)` many), and for each substring, check if it's a palindrome. A
palindrome check takes linear time, so this is total `O(n**3)` time, or cubic
time.

```ruby
def longest_palindrome(string)
  best_palindrome_start = 0
  best_palindrome_len = 0

  0.upto(string.length - 1).each do |start|
    # micro-optimization: don't look at substrings shorter than best
    # palindrome.
    len = best_palindrome_len + 1
    while start + len <= string.length
      if is_palindrome?(string, start, len)
        best_palindrome_start, best_palindrome_len = start, len
      end

      len += 1
    end
  end

  [best_palindrome_start, best_palindrome_start + best_palindrome_len - 1]
end

def is_palindrome?(string, start, len)
  len.times do |i|
    if string[start + i] != string[(start + len - 1) - i]
      return false
    end
  end

  true
end
```

This obviously sucks. We can do better. If we realize that every biggest
palindrome will have many smaller palindromes nested inside it, we realize that
we don't have to look at every palindrome separately; we can linearly scan
through the array, and for each index in the array (or space between indices),
check to see what's the largest palindrome *centered* there.

This approach will take `O(n**2)` time and `O(1)` space.

```ruby
def longest_palindrome(str)
    longest_length = 0
    longest_begin = 0

    str.length.times do |i|
        stretch = 0
        # expand out from char i, and see if there's an expanding palindrome
        # (for odd palindrome lengths)
        loop do
            break unless both_in_range?(i + stretch, i - stretch, str)

            if str[i - stretch] == str[i + stretch]
                this_pal_length = stretch * 2 + 1
                if this_pal_length > longest_length
                    longest_length = this_pal_length
                    longest_begin = i - stretch
                end
            else
              break
            end

            stretch += 1
        end

        # now check centering around the spaces between chars
        # (for even palindrome lengths)
        stretch = 0
        loop do
            break unless both_in_range?(i + stretch + 1, i - stretch, str)

            if str[i - stretch] == str[i + stretch + 1]
                this_pal_length = stretch * 2 + 2
                if this_pal_length > longest_length
                    longest_length = this_pal_length
                    longest_begin = i - stretch
                end
            else
              break
            end

            stretch += 1
        end
    end

    str.slice(longest_begin, longest_length)
end

def both_in_range?(i1, i2, str)
    [i1, i2].all? { |idx| idx.between?(0, str.length - 1) }
end
```

There is a way to do this in linear time, but it involves a degree of insight
that you'd never be expected to achieve in an interview. You can read more about
the linear time algorithm below, known as [Manacher's Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_palindromic_substring).
