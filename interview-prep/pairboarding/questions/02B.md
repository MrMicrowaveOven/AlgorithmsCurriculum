 ## Introduction
 
 Walk me through your resume.  
 
 **NB**: This is your cue to do your personal pitch.
 
 ## Take Pride 
 
 What project or accomplishment are you most proud of?
  		  
 +Your answer should tell the interviewer a story:
 +
 + - Summarize the project or accomplishment 
 + - What task or problem were you trying to solve?
 + - What in particular makes this something that you're proud of?  What did you learn?  How did you grow throughout the process?
 + - What was the result?  What did you accomplish or how was the project/workplace improved?

## `valid_ip?`

Write a method that takes a string as input. It should return true if
the input is a valid IPv4 address (ie. anything between `0.0.0.0` and
`255.255.255.255` is valid).

```ruby
def valid_ip?(str)
  return false unless str =~ /^\d+(\.\d+){3}$/
  nums = str.split(".").map(&:to_i)
  nums.all? {|num| num >= 0 && num <= 255}
end
```

## `sum_from_file`

Write a method that reads in a file of integers, one per line, and
sums them. Skip the line if it begins with a `"#"`.

```ruby
def sum_from_file(filename)
  nums = File
    .readlines(filename)
    .select { |line| line[0] != "#" }
    .map(&:to_i)

  nums.inject(:+)
end
```

## `shuffle`

You are given an array and a random number generator. Shuffle the
array.

```ruby
def shuffle(array)
  new_array = array.dup
  array.each_index do |index|
    # notice how each time it moves the number at `index` out of the
    # way so it may be sampled later.
    rand_index = index + rand(array.length - index)
    new_array[index], new_array[rand_index] =
      new_array[rand_index], new_array[index]
  end
  new_array
end
```

* Time complexity: `O(n)`.
