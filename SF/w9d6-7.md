## W9D6-7
* Fix any last bugs in your Capstone Project. Update URL on Progress Tracker and **turn in your project by Monday 9am.**
  * Make sure you go through the [checklist][capstone-checklist]
  * a/A students are usually excellent about assignments and attendance.  If your due dates lag or you miss roll call, however, you may find yourself in violation of your a/A job search contract.  Be diligent and turn your projects in on time.
  * **As soon as a project becomes so big you can't make visible improvements to it under an hour, stop working on it.**
  * If you haven't crafted a readme for your capstone project, do so now.  [See examples.][readme]
* This week, you will be expected to create your [resume][resume], [cover letter][cover-letter], [browser game][browser-game], [portfolio site][portfolio], and [code_intensive][code-intensive].  You will also clean up your  [GitHub][github], [LinkedIn][linkedin], and AngelList profiles.  If you have the chance to start on application materials, do so. The quicker you get everything done, the quicker you'll have a job.
* If this list is overwhelming, work on your resume and JS game first.  Expected time investment for each item -
  * Resume: 5-15 hours (1-3 hours/day each day this week)
  * Cover letter: 2-4 hours
  * JS game: 10-20 hours (even longer if your project is too ambitious or original)
  * Ruby project: 3-10 hours
  * Github cleanup & Readme's: 3-6 hours
  * LinkedIn & AngelList profiles: 2-4 hours
  * Portfolio site: 3-8 hours (recommended but not required)
