## Creating a Snappy, Professional LinkedIn 

A good, polished LinkedIn profile is essential during the job search, especially in the tech industry.  Your LinkedIn will often be the first thing that potential employers, recruiters, and useful contacts look at as they try to evaluate your professional credentials.  

### Elements of Your LinkedIn Profile

#### Summary  

The summary is one of the most important parts of your LinkedIn, especially as a job-seeker.  It's also the most difficult to write.  Unlike the rest of your LinkedIn, it's a chance to inject some individuality and personality into your profile.  Ideally, you want it to be unique, eye-catching, professional, and personal all at the same time (see why it's the hard part?).  There's room to be creative and flexible in the summary, though -- it can be long-ish or short, include images, bring in a variety of pieces from your background -- whatever tells your story the best.  Here are a couple examples that show how widely summaries can vary:

**Charles:**

"I'm a curious puzzle-solver who enjoys poring over server logs and error messages. I have a passion for software that sews together the desktop and mobile experiences. I'm an enthusiastic teammate and a patient communicator. I have a near-compulsive desire to explore the unfamiliar. My favorite languages are Ruby, Javascript, and Korean."

**Theresa:**

"Simply put, I love to code. The sleuthwork of identifying the source of a bug (especially when the error message is less than helpful). The zen-like state of refactoring tests in a massive codebase. The excitement of implementing a long-anticipated feature. The consistent vacillation between questioning and understanding. 

I have a reputation for asking great questions, shipping quality code, being a strong pair and working well across teams."

**Majd:**

"People ask me what I do. Here's the list:

- Software Developer (Rhumbix)
- Mask Maker (Arté Masks)
- Thespian (Golden Thread Productions)
- Mentor (Dev Bootcamp)
- Capoeirista-in-training (Capoeira Angola Quintal)
- Acrobat-in-training (Circus Center)

That wraps up the career and hobbies. I had a 10-year theatre career before I went to a coding bootcamp and revamped my lifestyle. I'm the kind of guy who focuses on many pursuits at once, but really dives deep into all of those things. Triple Aries, Triple Sagittarius, and Mars in Gemini, for people who like astrology."

**Marc:**

"I’m a passionate software developer with the innovative and creative mindset of an entrepreneur. I have experience building dynamic web applications in JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, and HTML/CSS.

I love the battle of developing an idea into existence, and forging the bridge between conceptualization and a tangible, impactful product. Programming has been my outlet for problem-solving and creative expression."

Another note: you can include images in your summary.  Some folks include screenshots of their projects, which is a good way to showcase your work right off the bat.  

#### Profile Picture  

Use a picture that's friendly, but professional.  Don't use a photo in which you are drinking, partying, or dressed inappropriately (if you wouldn't show up to App Academy in the clothes you're wearing in the picture, find a different one).  A lot of folks use their App Academy photo in their LinkedIn profile, but you don't necessarily have to.  

#### Projects  
As an App Academy grad, the projects section of your LinkedIn is very important.  You can use the same bullet points that you use in your resume, but you have a little more flexibility on LinkedIn -- instead of limiting yourself to 3-4 projects, list everything substantial, polished, and complete that you've worked on.  You can (and should) include screenshots as well to show off your work, and you can be slightly more verbose when you're describing your project than you are in your resume. 

#### Experience

As with your projects, you can be a bit more expansive with your previous experience than in your resume.  Include any positions that fall into any of the following categories:

- Positions that involved quantitative/technical work or research 
- Positions in which you were a supervisor or had a lot of responsibility 
- Positions that you held for >1 year
- Positions that showcase any unique talents, skills, or knowledge that you have 

As with your resume, include a brief summary of the position and 3-5 bullet points describing your responsibilities.  When possible, get endorsements on LinkedIn from coworkers and supervisors from the positions you include.

#### Education

Include anything post-high school, even if it's not a degree from a STEM field.  List them in chronological order, with App Academy at the top.  It's not necessary to include informal/online education unless it was part of a certificate/degree program or was relatively formal in nature (e.g., if you did a part-time course through General Assembly before a/A, include it, but don't include Coursera courses).  

#### Skills

This is the place to showcase all of the technical skills that you've learned at App Academy and beyond.  List your strongest skills first (Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and React should be right at the top) followed by other programming skills, followed by any non-programming skills that you have.  Make sure that your settings on LinkedIn allow your connections to endorse your skills, and also take some time to endorse the skills of other students in your cohort (they'll likely reciprocate if you do so!).
