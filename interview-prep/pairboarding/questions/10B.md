## `max_unique_psub`

This is a hard one! Enjoy the challenge!

Let's define a **pseudo-substring**: `psub` is a pseudo-substring of
`str` if there exists some `[i_0, i_1, ..., i_n]` such that:

* `i_0, ..., i_n` is an **increasing sequence**; `i_l < i_m` for `l < m`.
* `psub[l] == str[i_l]`

For example:

```
"abc" is a psub of "abcdef"
"ace" is a psub of "abcdef"
"cdf" is a psub of "abcdef"

"fed" is _not_ a psub of "abcdef" (letters are out of order)

psubs("abcd") == [
  "a",
  "ab",
  "abc",
  "abcd",
  "ac",
  "acd",
  "ad",
  "b",
  "bc",
  "bcd",
  "bd",
  "c",
  "cd",
  "d"
]
```

Next, recall the definition of **lexicographical order**:

* `str1 > str2` IF
* (a) `str1 != str2` AND EITHER
* (b1) `str2` is a prefix of `str1` OR
* (b2) at the first position at which `str1` and `str2` differ (say
  `i`), `str1[i] > str2[i]`.

For instance: `"abc" > "ab"` and `"acb" > "abc"`.

**Given a string `str`, find the lexicographical greatest
psubstring.** Solve it first by generating all psubstrings and picking
the greatest (in Big-Oh, how many are there?).

Next, improve your algorithm to do this in `O(n)` time.

## Solution

```ruby
# Thanks Joshua for the inspiration!
# O(n**2)
def max_unique_psub(str)
  psub = str[str.length - 1]

  (str.length - 2).downto(0) do |i|
    next if str[i] < psub[0]
    # CAREFUL: this takes O(n) in the inner loop to copy the contents of
    # psub to create the new string.
    psub = str[i] + psub
  end

  psub
end
```

```ruby
# Slight rewriting that is O(n)
def max_unique_psub(str)
  psub_arr = [str[str.length - 1]]

  (str.length - 2).downto(0) do |i|
    next if str[i] < psub_arr.last
    # this is amortized O(1) time.
    psub_arr << str[i]
  end

  psub = psub_arr.reverse.join("")
  psub
end
```
