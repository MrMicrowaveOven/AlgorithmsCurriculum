## Introduction 

Walk me through your background.

**NB**: this is your cue to do your personal pitch.

## Resolving conflict 

Describe a time when you had a conflict with a coworker or collaborator and how you resolved it.

Your answer should tell the interviewer the following:

 - Summarize the situation that led to the conflict 
 - What steps did you take to resolving the conflict?
 - Did your resolution work?  How was the project and/or your relationship with the coworker improved in the process of resolving this conflict?
 
## `digital_root`

Write a method, `digital_root(num)`. It should sum the digits of a
positive integer. If it is greater than or equal to 10, sum the digits of the
resulting number. Keep repeating until there is only one digit in the
result, called the "digital root". Do not use string conversion within
your method.

```ruby
def digital_root(num)
  while num >= 10
    num = digital_root_step(num)
  end

  num
end

def digital_root_step(num)
  root = 0
  while num > 0
    root += (num % 10)

    num /= 10
  end

  root
end

#recursive solution

def digital_root_recur num
  return num if num < 10
  digital_root_recur((num % 10) + (num / 10))
end

```

## `caesar_cipher`

Write a function that takes a message and an increment amount and
outputs the same letters shifted by that amount in the
alphabet. Assume lowercase and no punctuation. Preserve spaces.

```ruby
def caesar_cipher(str, shift)
  letters = ("a".."z").to_a

  encoded_str = ""
  str.each_char do |char|
    if char == " "
      encoded_str << " "
      next
    end

    old_idx = letters.find_index(char)
    new_idx = (old_idx + shift) % letters.count

    encoded_str << letters[new_idx]
  end

  encoded_str
end
```
