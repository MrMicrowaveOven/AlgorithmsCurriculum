# Selling Yourself

## Why sell yourself?
* Division of labor: you tell them why they should hire you, they figure
  out whether they should. Don't do their job for them.
* People who sell themselves are people who take responsibility.
* a/A grads are a special case: Admissions selects for people who are
  good and don't have a traditional background. => Greater need to sell.

## How to sell yourself
Tell a Story, not various facts.

  0. A story has no randomness. No "my friend told me about App Academy"
  0. A story has an arc: starting point, intrigue, climax, resolution
  0. A story has one or two main turning points

## How to sell your work
* Identify its purpose.
* Your work is an extension of you. Any hiccup you ran into was an indication of how complex your project was.
* Identify hard problems you solved and core features.
* Mention work in progress

## Homework
Create a file why-companies-should-hire-me.md.

In it, make these two lists:

  * Your Life's Story
    0. Guiding thread.
    0. Starting point.
    0. Major turning points: "I picked up Chris Pine's *Learn to
       Program*" or "I built a script to translate numbers to English"
    0. Achievements: "I was employee of the month four months in a row"
  * Coding Projects
    0. Feature highlights for each app: find out what these are by
       describing your app to others.
    0. Gnarly bugs you solved: understand these well, explain them
       clearly
    0. Cool solutions you came up with: these too. Review your code and
       make the list.
    0. Reasons you chose each 3rd party library in your app: even if you
       didn't
       consider alternatives, know what you liked about the one you did
use.
