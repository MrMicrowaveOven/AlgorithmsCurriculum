# Curating Your Github

## Make it personal
* A strongly branded Github is more welcoming and tells employers you
  care about the code you publish.    
* Add your first name and last name under *settings > profile*. This
  makes it easier for employers to find you and review your code.    
* Make sure you have a profile picture and that you're recognizable on
  it. This is an easy way to strengthen the connection with employers who review your code, and to make sure they remember who you are after interviewing you.

## Merge and format
* Merge most of your repositories into one.
    * The very early ones.
    * Very incomplete projects.
* Rename the repos that you keep.
    * Give them enticing descriptions and useful ReadMe's.
    * Make sure to remove all lines of code that you'd commented out.
      * The `git grep` command is your friend.
    * Do this in your browser so that their last commit is from you and not 'App Academy Student'.

## Cool Repos to Keep
* ActiveRecord Lite
* Rails Lite
* Asteroids
* Snake
* Tic-Tac-Toe & Tower of Hanoi
* Ruby recursion exercises (if they're complete)
* BFS, DFS, Knight's Travails, 8 Queens, Word Chains
* Node Chat App
* Trellino

In the post-course curriculum you will learn about data structures and algorithms.
You will implement linked lists, binary trees, hashes, etc. in Ruby.
These implementations are actually rare in Ruby, so these are cool things to have.
Keep them in explicitly named repos, eg. "Ruby Linked List". Employers will <3.
