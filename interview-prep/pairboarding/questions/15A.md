**Given an input stream of numbers, implement a function that would return a single number from the stream with an equal chance probability of being selected when compared with all other numbers in the stream. So, if the stream were 10 in size, any given number should have a 1 in 10 chance of being returned. Implement this in O(1) memory space (constant memory).**

The trick is a bit of math, and to start from the simplest case (see interviewing tips). Consider:

* If we had just one element in the stream, which would we return? The single element we have.
* If we now add a second element, which would we return? Either the one from the previous iteration, or the new one.
* How do we pick? We could just flip a coin. 50%-50%.
* Generalize from there.

  ```ruby
    def random(stream)
        number_stored = nil
        numbers_seen_so_far = 0
    
        stream.each do |el|
          numbers_sees_so_far += 1
    
          if Random.rand(numbers_seen_so_far) == 0 # returns a random integer that's less than the argument.
            number_stored = el
          end
        end
    
        number_stored
      end
  ```

**Suppose an array of arrays representing a matrix. All rows are the same length but rows and columns may be of different lengths (ie. the matrix may be rectangular). Write a function that prints the values in the matrix in spiral order from the outside inward.**
