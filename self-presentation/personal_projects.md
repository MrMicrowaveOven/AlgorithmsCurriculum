# Personal Projects

**As soon as a project becomes so big you can't make visible improvements to it under an hour, stop working on it.**

 Definitely do:
* Set up [Pingdom][pingdom].
* Populate a demo login if your app has authentication.
* Remove unneeded lines of code that you had left commented-out.

 Optionally do:
* Write some tests for your app with RSpec.
    * RSpec can come up in interviews so it's good to practice.
    * Some employers love to see tests in your Github.
* Styling and positioning, eg. with [Twitter Bootstrap][bootsrap].
* Set up [Omniauth][omniauth].
