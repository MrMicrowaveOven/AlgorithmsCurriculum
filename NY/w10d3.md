## Application Materials
* **Whenever you aren't pairboarding, peer reviewing, or finding companies to apply to you should be improving your application materials and portfolio.**

### [Jobberwocky][jobberwocky]
* Add 10 companies per day until you find a job.
* Edit the status to "Will Apply" until you send your application.
* Hover over the company name to add application details.
* While you're researching the company, craft your company blurb. For more about blurbs, see the [cover letter][cover-letter] page.
  * Rank companies 1 to 3
    * 3 means "Not dying to work there" or "Don't know enough about them". Should be 45-55% of them.
    * 2 means "Looks like a cool place". Should be 35-40% of them.
    * 1 means "Want to work there". Should be 10-15%
* To find companies, see the Companies tab in Jobberwocky, the Tech Companies spreadsheets ([NY][ny-tech-companies] & [SF][bay-tech-companies]) or any other job board.  Some suggested job boards are [here][job-boards].
