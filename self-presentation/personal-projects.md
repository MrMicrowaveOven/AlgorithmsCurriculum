# Personal Projects

**As soon as a project becomes so big you can't make visible improvements to it under an hour, stop working on it.**

## Phase One

0. Add your project to our [hall of fame of alumni
  projects][alumni-projects].
0. Set up [Uptime Robot][uptimerobot].
0. Populate a demo login if your app has authentication.
    * **Make it very easy for employers log in and look around.**
    * A button on your login page should fill the username and password fields.
    * Have fun seed data so employers aren't looking at a ghost town.
      [This gem][seed-dump] should be helpful.
0. Remove print statements and lines of code that you had commented-out.

## Phase Two

0. Write some tests for your app with RSpec + Capybara.
    * RSpec can come up in interviews so it's important to practice.
    * Many employers love to see tests in your Github.
0. Create a guided tour that starts when someone logs in as a guests.
