# After getting an offer

 As soon as you get an offer:
1. Ask for two weeks to think about it. Odds are this is your first job as a web developer so you shouldn't be rushed to decide.
2. Email every company you've ever contacted, even if they never got back to you. Tell them you have an offer elsewhere but you really like what their company does. You would love to go through their application process so that you can include them in your final decision.
3. If you already have an interview scheduled somewhere and it's in less than a week, you can wait until then to let them know. If it's in more than a week, ask if you can do it sooner.


Here's a sample email for your inspiration.

*Hi [contact person/this company name],*

*I applied to join your team last week and am currently waiting to hear back. I wanted to let you know I've received an offer from ["another technology company" / other company name if it's a good one]. I have two weeks to get back to them. While it's an interesting offer, I admire what [this company] does and would love to see your application process through before making a final decision. I hope to hear back from your team soon.*


*All the best,*

*Me*
