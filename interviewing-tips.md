# Interviewing tips

## Apply to a lot of places

**Apply to a lot of places**. Somebody out there wants to hire you,
but you need to find that person. You don't know how quickly you'll
get offers, so don't be too choosy when applying; be choosy when you
have offers.

**A good goal is to send out 20 resumes a day.** A lot of entry-level
devs find jobs through [job listing boards](job-boards.md). Send a
resume to every company that is looking for Ruby, Rails, Python,
Django people. You'll hear back from ~1/10, but this just means send
out more resumes.

**Ignore job requirements**. If a place is hiring a senior Rails dev,
they probably want entry-level people, too. Look up if there is a more
appropriate position to apply for on their company website. Send a
resume to the most relevant, even if it doesn't look like a perfect
fit. Lots of companies have openings they don't list.

## Resume

* Limit to two pages max.
* Focus strongly on your projects, technology.
* Lookup the right capitalization, spelling of the techs you used. It
  looks really dumb if you get this wrong.

## Whiteboarding style

* Be confident; even if you don't know the answer, try to engage the
  problem, don't give up. If you keep telling an interviewer you don't
  know how to do something, they'll start to believe you.
* Take a few seconds to think about the problem before starting. You
  don't have to have the whole solution in your head; these problems
  are meant to be worked over on a board. But you should have a bit of
  direction.
* Ask clarifying questions as necessary.
* Talk through the problem; they want to see the process going on in
  your head. If you don't talk, the interviewer doesn't learn how you
  break-down and analyze a problem.
* The interviewer may give you hints. They will ask questions to keep
  you on track. Don't be flustered or think you're failing; this is
  normal.
* Don't explicitly ask for hints, though. If you are truly stuck
  or don't know how to begin, ask questions.
* Start by solving a simpler version of the problem, or provide a very
  simplistic solution, even if it is slow, just to get get some
  partial credit points on the board.
* If they ask you "does this work", take a moment to think. Walk
  through the steps; out loud is fine. If you say yes, say it like you
  believe it; interviewers don't like to think people are just
  praying they'll get the answer right.
* If you hit a hard part, tell the interviewer that you recognize that
  your approach to the problem has hit a snag, and that you'll have to
  fix something.

## Your questions when interviewing

**TODO**

* Read up on the company
* Tell me about something you worked on. What was the most difficult part.
* Read up on companies, see what they are hiring for.
* Have questions for them.

## Salary negotation
* If asked for salary expectations, just say that you want to be paid
  commensurate with what other people in your position are offered.
* If they press you, say that you are talking to many places and that
  you don't want to prejudge your salary before offers come in.
* If you get an offer, tell all other companies you are interviewing
  at. They will probably more quickly bring you in to interview.
* Even if you don't want to work somewhere, it can be worth
  interviewing to get additional offers to push up salary somewhere
  you do want to work. I strongly, **strongly** recommend interviewing
  everywhere that will have you.
* If you receive a second offer, tell other employers who have made
  you an offer (if it is more, I suppose). Ask for them to match it.
* Typical recruiters have discretion to increase an offer by $5k; you
  need to ask, though.
