# Post-Course Curriculum

[TODO](./TODO.md)

## Daily Schedule
09:00AM - 12:00PM: Whiteboard problems    
12:00PM - 01:00PM: Lunch    
01:00PM - 03:00PM: Apply to jobs    
03:00PM - 06:00PM: Build Rails/JS projects and do readings    
06:00PM - 09:00PM: Network (meetups/events), blog, and build Rails/JS projects

9pm:               Stop programming. Sleep + hang out with friends (read: other classmates + developers). 

                     Happy + highly productive developers are the most impressive kind

As much as possible, try to schedule interviews from 12:00PM - 03:00PM.
That way, you'll be able to do as much whiteboarding and app building
together as possible.
