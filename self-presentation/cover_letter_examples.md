**Example letter #1**

Hi [Name or Team],

I am a web developer with experience building rich web apps in Javascript and Rails. I'm currently looking to join a team where I can help build interesting projects and continue to grow as a developer. I'm excited to find out whether [Company] and I are a good fit. [company blurb]

My most recent project is [project].com, a book recommendation engine for Harry Potter fans. Through tagging, rating, commenting, filtering, and collective filtering features, the site helps people find additional works they might enjoy. 

I built my first website when I was 14, and have been involved in technology ever since. I worked for my first tech startup when I was 19, got a Bachelors of Science in Information Systems, worked as a technology consultant with Bechtel. 

I look forward to meeting you to further discuss employment opportunities with [Company Name].

**Example letter #2** 


Dear { companyName } team,

I’m a software developer with experience in Ruby, JS and React.js, and a background in molecular biology. I'm looking for new opportunities to develop technological solutions for users. { companyBlurb }

My previous projects include [project name as link], a photo-hosting website where photo albums and photos can be uploaded and tagged using the Cloudinary API and the Google Places API. The website uses jQuery UI to enable photo rearrangement, allowing users the ability to narrate their albums in a specific order. To improve the site’s responsiveness, HTML elements are automatically resized using a combination of Bootstrap and jQuery. 

Additional information on my background and projects are in the attached resume and can be viewed on my portfolio page(as link). Please let me know if you have any questions, and I look forward to hearing from you.

**Example #3**

Hello [ company ] Team,

I'm a huge fan of company X because of Y and my experience with Z. I think my background and skills would be a great fit for your company.

I am a web engineer with a background in Ruby, Javascript, and frameworks such as Rails and Backbone. An example of my work can be viewed at www.[project].com. It features the ability for users to create running teams. Members can then easily create events for their teams. The site is built on a Rails backend with Backbone serving as the responsive front end. Mapbox.js is utilized to allow users to produce beautiful maps of running routes that can be included in events so that the entire team can see the course.

In addition to my programming skills, I have gained invaluable experience as a US Army pilot, flying the KC-10 on critical missions around the world. As an officer, I was entrusted with flying an $80M aircraft and leading a crew of up to 15 officers. Flexibility and the ability to react to rapidly changing situations were key skills necessary to successfully complete over 50 missions.

My past jobs and training have focused on quickly learning a vast array of new material and immediately applying it. I'm looking forward to contributing to an exciting and fast paced team at [company].

Hey [company],

I’d love to be the newest developer on your team. My resume is attached, but to give you a quick rundown on who I am, here are the bullet points:

**I have experience committing production code** -
I’ve jumped into a code base, been on-boarded, and written tests to cover my code. I’ve also contributed to open source projects, and have been learning and practicing web development for a year. I am confident I can hit the ground running, and quickly add value to your team.

**I know how to work** -
I studied [field] at [university], and the skills I learned there have served me well -- persevering through tough problems, learning new things constantly, pursuing goals as a team, meeting tight deadlines -- I’m sure you’ll appreciate them too.

**I add value to companies in innovative ways** -
For 2 years I was in India, working for a small, venture-backed team doing big things in serialization and patient engagement in the pharmaceutical industry. As such, I had to wear many hats; I helped coordinate a 6 month sales-drive that brought the company to profitability, wrote a grant that won $30,000 from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and spec’ed out an internal business logic engine, amount other things. I am able to identify low hanging fruit better than others only having experience in one area.

**I know how to learn** -
I recently completed rigorous training in SQL, Ruby, Rails, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Backbone.js at App Academy over the past couple months, successfully learning new material at a rate few others can endure for 12 weeks straight. Before that, I taught myself how to dual boot Linux on my pc without blowing everything up (or at least, how to have a backup ready when I did blow things up). As the tech world changes faster, being able to learn new things quickly will only become more important.

If you guys are looking for a sincere, hard working dude that can destroy you in ping pong, let’s connect and continue the conversation!

Looking forward to your reply,

Lawrence Davies
