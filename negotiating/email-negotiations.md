# After getting an offer

 As soon as you get an offer:    
1. Ask for two weeks to think about it. Odds are this is your first job as a web developer so you shouldn't be rushed to decide.    
2. Email every company you've ever contacted, even if they never got back to you. Tell them you have an offer elsewhere but you really like what their company does. You would love to go through their application process so that you can include them in your final decision.    
3. If you already have an interview scheduled somewhere and it's in less than a week, you can wait until then to let them know. If it's in more than a week, ask if you can do it sooner.    


Here's a sample email for your inspiration.

*Hi [contact person/this company name],*

*I applied to join your team last week and am currently waiting to hear back. I wanted to let you know I've received another offer [from /company name/ if it's a good one]. I have two weeks to get back to them. While it's an interesting offer, I admire what [this company] does and would love to see your application process through before making a final decision. I hope to hear back from your team soon.*


*All the best,*

*Me*


# If they are in a hurry

Many companies will whine about how long two weeks is in their
fast-paced startup world. Resist this. You're looking to make a
long-term commitment and it's in no-one's interest to rush it. If they
insist, you're in a very strong position to ask them for a higher offer.


# If the offer is low

Do not fret over asking for more. Companies do not have feelings. They are however a lot more likely to train you well if they're paying a fair market rate.    

This is a real email a student wrote. The outcome was successful.    

*Thank you for extending me the offer of employment as a Junior  Developer at [company name].  I really enjoyed getting to meet with [interview name], [interview name], and [interview name] on Monday and think the team is definitely the right cultural fit for me.  Your company does some seriously interesting work and I think it's a great opportunity to learn skills that I won't find elsewhere.*

*In light of my skills, however, I am concerned about the salary you offered. App Academy is a rigorous program with a 5% acceptance rate and a 10% attrition rate.  This year App Academy graduates have been finding an average starting salary of $92,000. Given my track record of being a top performer, I see my market value as $95,000.  If you can put together that offer, I will sign immediately and cancel all other interviews.*

*Again, I am really looking forward to joining your team and can't wait to start on 9/23/2013 as you requested.  But in order to do that, I need you to make me a more competitive offer.*
