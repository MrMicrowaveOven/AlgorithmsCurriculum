# Link Yourself In


## Layout

Unlike your résumé, no need to delete all non-web-related experience from your LinkedIn.

If you're going to keep something non-web-related though, put it at the bottom of your page.

Your layout might look like this:    
1. Summary    
2. Skills & Expertise    
3. Projects    
4. Education / Experience (whichever is most impressive)    


## Content

Your title is 'web developer' ("full stack" implies a couple years' experience).
You can add "for hire" or something to that effect in your title.

 Have an exciting summary    
* Mention you are looking for opportunities    
* List your main skills: Rails, JavaScript...    

A profile picture doesn't hurt.

 Include all web-related skills under "Skills and Expertise"
* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Backbone.js
* SQL
* Git
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* TDD
* Web Development
* MVC

Delete non-web- or tech-related skills. You don't want to be a jack-of-all trades.
