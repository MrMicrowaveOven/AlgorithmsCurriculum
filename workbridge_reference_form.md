*How long have you known the candidate?*

[candidate]'s class at App Academy started on [date] and I taught her every weekday for a 12 week period.


*What is/was the work relationship? (i.e. Peer, Supervisor, End User, etc.)*

I was [candidate]'s head instructor.


*Describe the candidate’s responsibilities*

She learned Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, JavaScript, Backbone.js, and other web development technologies in the course of our 9 week program. The day at App Academy starts with lectures and demonstrations around a given topic, supported by readings from the previous evening. Students spend the rest of the day building projects that crucially involve that topic.


*What are the candidate’s technical strengths?*

What impressed me the most about [candidate] was her ability to work her way through a problem. One four occasions I saw her build out a project beyond what was assigned because she'd figured out what tools she needed to add functionality and was able to learn from documentation.


*What other strengths does the candidate offer? (i.e. reliability,
personality, etc.)*

App Academy relies heavily on pair programming as a teaching method. Students are paired with a different class member every day. Those who paired with [candidate] reported that they enjoyed pairing with her. She seems to articulate her solutions clearly in a way that facilitates collaboration. She and her pair were often among the first to complete the day's project.


*How does the candidate relate to others? (What is he/she like to work with?)*

It is clear she enjoys programming and likes to share the experience. She always seemed eager to learn from her instructors and peers in order to improve her code. She has been very receptive to feedback.


*Do you have any concerns or negative things to say about the candidate?*


[This is just a suggestion for something that's negative but irrelevant. We'll probably want a different answer for each student.] 

[Candidate] has a lot of enthusiasm. She would ask many questions during lectures, some of which were beyond the scope of the day. This would sometimes get in the way of other students' learning.


*Given the chance, would you work with this candidate again?*

Yes.
