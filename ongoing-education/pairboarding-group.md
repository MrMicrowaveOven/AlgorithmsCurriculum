# Ongoing Pairboarding Practice Group

Open to all graduates of App Academy, this weekly pairboarding group is intended to give job seekers the chance to keep their whiteboarding skills sharp.

We meet at **1:15 pm** on **Thursdays** at App Academy's new office:  
160 Spear Street, 14th Floor  
San Francisco

Our first meeting will be on **February 4th, 2016**.

The structure of each meeting will be a brief check-in circle, to talk about the job search, seek advice, and share triumphs. Participants will then be split into pairs to solve algorithm problems. **Students are encouraged to bring problems if they have them.**

To express interest in the group and receive updates and reminders, please [join the associated Google Group][aa-group]. If the meeting is cancelled for a particular day, it will be announced through this Google Group.
