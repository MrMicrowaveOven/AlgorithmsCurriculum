## Pairboarding and Technical Interview Practice
* If you haven't already, see App Academy's list of [Interview Questions][interview-questions].  These questions have been collected from real interviews.
* Continue pairboarding. Remember to go through the 10 steps for every problem!

## Jobberwocky
* Begin submitting materials for review.
* Don't forget to give us "Can Edit" permissions, not just "Can Comment"
* Check back frequently to see if we've reviewed it and sent it back to you. If it's not marked as completed, resolve the to-dos and resubmit for another review.
* Continue to add 10 `will apply` applications per day.
